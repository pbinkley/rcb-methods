               <head>The Book</head>

               <p>The point of reference from which the problem of reproducing research materials must be examined is the system by which publishers
                  produce books and libraries acquire, arrange and store them for use. The financial policies of institutions, the stack room and
                  reading room equipment of libraries, the training of library personnel as well as the research habits of scholars are standardized
                  in favor of the use of books of several hundred pages, from six to eleven inches in height, costing the purchaser from one-half to
                  two cents a page.</p>

               <p>There are other forms in which research material is made accessible, but in any of these other forms there is created a special
                  problem of finance or administration. Maps, newspapers, "oversize" books, manuscript collections, films, collections of pamphlets
                  and broadsides present special difficulties and cause. special expenses regardless of their acquisition costs. <pb n="2"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=23"/> The normal acquisition costs of books or bound
                  volumes of periodicals which can be shelved like books is something less than five dollars a volume. In a public library which
                  purchases a large amount or popular fiction it falls to $1.30 a volume. The list prices of books per hundred pages, as given in
                  standard annual boot-lists are as follows:</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Analysis of Book cost</head>

               <p>The cost accountancy of book production is very complicated, but the essential fact is simple: the unit cost of producing a book
                  falls rapidly as the size of the edition increases. This is the crux of the problem that must be faced in any plan which will seek
                     <pb n="3" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=24"/> to follow the requirements of
                  research rather than the demands of the market in deciding what materials are to be reduced to book form. When the prospective
                  market and hence the size of the salable edition is small, the unit cost of the volumes rises above the level at which normal
                  purchasing policies by institutions or individuals will float the enterprise or accomplish adequate distribution. The critical test
                  of book cost, for the purposes at this survey, is the minimum size of an edition which can be sold within the normal price
                  range.</p>

               <p>Another striking characteristic of book costs is the large percentage of the sales price which goes to other objects than actual
                  printing. A great university press calculates that two fifths of the cost of a book are strictly manufacturing costs, one fifth is
                  editorial and general overhead, and two fifths selling costs. Another university press bases its price calculation on the following
                  procedure:</p>

               <head>Library costs.</head>

               <p>The purchase price of the book is not the heaviest expense that has to be met in making it available to a scholar in a library.
                  Library finances must be given a place in the total picture, because different methods of reproducing materials fit differently into
                  the scheme of library finance. But the cost analysis of library administration is a disputed field, in which the files of the
                  Library Journal report a prolonged controversy. The most active work in cost analysis has been applied to the study of cataloguing
                  cost -- the cost of putting the book on the shelves. The figures which seem best attested are those of the University of California
                  (72¢) per book. The general administrative expense of a library cannot be pro-rated with any accuracy among individual books, but
                  must be taken into account. Figures collected by the Government show that university libraries spend from 50% to 72% of their funds
                  for other than acquisition purposes (50% Cornell, 72% Yale). The normal amount is about two thirds. But the capital cost of building
                  and land is not included in this figure. A library like the <pb n="7"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=28"/> New York Public Library, which must take into
                  account a high cost of land, maintains an enormous capital investment in land and buildings. All libraries must be expanded from
                  time to time to keep pace with the increasing quantity of material and numbers of readers. If the financing of this expansion (which
                  may amount to the doubling of the plant every twenty years) be calculated as an element of library expense the capital cost may be
                  as high as double the administrative coat, or four times the cost of purchasing books. These considerations become especially
                  important in connection with manuscript or pamphlet material, for which the administrative cost is high, --or in connection with
                  bound newspaper files, against which an abnormal housing charge must be assessed. It can be roughly calculated that the expenses of
                  bringing a book from the press to the scholar's cubicle in the library multiply at such a rate that for every hundred dollars
                  devoted to library facilities for study, the amount that goes into book production may be anything from a minimum of 3.50 to a
                  maximum of 14.00. One dollar spent to manufacture a book (royalties, press - work, binding, and editing) must have from six to <pb

            <head>II. Methods of Reproducing Material</head>

            <p>Just as the policies of publishers and librarians set business standards for all enterprises in the field of scholarly publication, so
               printing from raised type sets a technological standard. But printing from raised type is now being challenged by other methods of
               reproducing texts. The new methods combine in various ways the principles of lithography, typewriting and photography, or make use of
               photography alone. Substitutes for printing are so many that the whole technology is in a state of flux, with prospects of
               revolutionary change. Two revolutionary processes, on the borderline of practical application today, are photo-compositing (preparation
               of lithographic master-copy by photographing letters directly on a page), and filmslide photography (reduction of text to a miniature
               slide, to be read by projection on a screen). The inventors and promoters of the new devices are concerned very little with the
               scholar's problem. <pb n="9" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=30"/> Lithographic printing
               methods are commercialized in response to the needs of advertisers, and filmslide photography is receiving its most successful
               development in connection with the needs of abstracting and title-guaranty companies. If the scholar's needs are met by the new
               processes, it is only in an incidental or accidental way.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Printing from Raised Type</head>

               <p>Typesetting for ordinary straight printing of text can be done most economically on one of the composing machines, which are of two
                  kinds. The most common cast type in slugs of one line. (Mergenthaler, Intertype, Ludlow (for display work), Typograph, and
                  Victorline). The Discotype, which is not yet on the market, is a machine for casting separate type pieces of 1/2 depth and then
                  uniting them in a slug. The Monotype, together with its defunct relative, the Stringertype, casts the letters separately but in
                  correct order, so that it can be used either as a type foundry or for setting straight copy. Hand-set type is used principally in
                  connection with advertising compositions. It is a luxury <pb n="10"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=31"/> when used in straight textual matter.</p>

               <p>The estimating of printing costs is a very complicated process which has been standardized by the United Typothetae of America. The
                  typographic cost follows the number or words rather than the size of page or of the type. A 50,000 word job of linotyping estimated
                  at $5.00 per machine hour will cost $170 set in 4½ point type, and $180 set in 7 point (newsprint) type. (See Fred W. Hoch: "The
                  Standard Book on Estimating for Printers", United Typothetae of America, Washington, D.C.)</p>

               <p>For any ordinary short run, the type as set in its flat form is used. But if the greater running efficiency of the rotary press is
                  to be obtained, the type face must be transferred to another printing surface, either by making a matrix for casting a stereotype or
                  by making an impression in wax, which is then coated electrolytically with copper to make an electrotype. Another device for
                  transferring from the type as set to a new surface is to print it on a thin metal sheet for use in the offset press. This third
                  method will be discussed in the next section.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=32"/>

               <p>The interest of scholarship in cheap and small editions is most nearly approximated in the commercial world by the demand for a
                  small office printing equipment, of which the Multigraph is the standard for raised type printing, and the Rotaprint for offset
                  printing.</p>

               <p>The merit of the Multigraph is that it can make printing look like typewriting through the use of a ribbon, which is an achievement
                  diametrically opposed to the wish of the scholar, who would like to see typewriting look like printing. Multigraph typesetting is
                  usually done by hand, but with the "Compotype" apparatus characters are embossed on strips of aluminum and the strips assembled on a
                  flexible sheet metal blanket which is then printed on the Multigraph. Th» economies in Multigraph over print shop work are to be
                  found in the wage scale of the operators. Quotations from a multigrapn company upon straight text work are equal to the highest
                  printer's quotation.</p>
            </div>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Mime-O-Form.</head>

               <p>There is a modification of the Multigraph developed by Mr. Ernest Kletsch in Washington, D.C. and called the Mime-O-Form. A Monotype
                  typecasting machine has been equipped to cast type for a Multigraph. The Multigraph printing method is so economical for short runs
                  that its prices compare favorably with the cheapest printing or offset printing quotations and are not much higher than
                  mimeographing. Its product is a book in ordinary type face, almost indistinguishable from the product of a regular book printing
                  press. (See sample page in appendix)</p>

               <p>So great is the variation in prices quoted for printing small editions that it is evident that the business and labor policies have
                  as much effect <pb n="13" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=34"/> as the technical process
                  itself upon small edition costs.</p>

               <p>The following tabulation of sixteen printing quotations illustrates the variation. The Feather Co. and Savage Co. are Cleveland
                  firms doing a book printing business; the Polk Co. is a Multigraph firm; the Mime-0-Form is the combination of monotype and
                  multigraph referred to above; J. Gamber is a publisher in Paris, France who specializes in university thesis work and hence in small
                  editions. His prices are here corrected to allow the 10% addition for English language work and the 25% customs duty. Edwards
                  Brothers, the National Process Co., Washington Planograph, and Coxhead Corporation are users of the offset method, which will be
                  further described in the next chapter. It must be explained at this point, however, that offset printing quotations are of two
                  kinds, representing two classes or work. The higher price is asked for the reproduction of a text which the offset printer copies on
                  a typewriter to make a master-copy from which he makes, photographically, his printing surface. The lower price is for the
                  reproduction of a text which goes to the printer as a <pb n="14"

                  typescript or the pages of a printed book. The higher quotation includes a typewriting charge. The quotations from the Lund,
                  Humphries (London) are taken from G.B. Harrison's paper on "Facsimile Reprints", given before the Anglo-American Conference of

               <p>The various processes thus take the following order as regards cost. Printing in France is cheapest, and offset printing by Edwards
                  Brothers next. Then comes Mime-O-Form in editions up to 1150, and low-quotation printing in editions above that figure. The size of
                  an edition necessary to reduce book cost below a dollar a hundred pages runs from 50 (French printing) to 525 (Multigraph). It is
                  obvious that many factors other than technique influence these prices. The "Ratios for Printing Management" gathered by the United
                  Typothetas of America show that only 73% of the income of a printing business goes into production or "factory costs". This 73% is
                  made up of fixed charges (6%), materials (34%) and running costs (33%). The differences in technique would affect principally
                  certain subdivisions of this running cost item, which is only 33% of the total sales price. In small edition printing the proportion
                  applied to materials falls as low as 20%. New technical processes often exert their greatest influence on price through their use of
                  untrained or half trained labor.</p>

               <head>The "Offset" Methods. Lithography and Photography.</head>

               <p>The most interesting development in contemporary printing technique is the encroachment of "offset printing" upon printing from
                  raised type. Offset printing has developed in the last thirty years from the combined application of principles of lithography and
                  photography, together with a new type of printing press.</p>

               <p>Lithography was developed by applying the principle that grease repels water but attracts a greasy ink. A stone surface was covered
                  with the greasy marks of a lithographic pencil, then moistened, and then inked. The ink would adhere to the pencil marks, avoid the
                  moistened spaces, and transfer to paper as a lithographic print.</p>

               <p>This principle is now applied by substituting a thin sheet of zinc or aluminum for the lithographic stone, a coating or a
                  light-sensitive albumin or bitumin compound for the lithographic pencil, and photography for the craft of the artist. The metal
                  plate with its albumin or bitumen coating acts exactly like photographic paper except that it requires a much longer exposure to
                  light.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=39"/>

               <p>Printed or typewritten pages, together with illustrations, are copied on the metal either directly from the object or indirectly
                  from a film negative. The metal sheet then takes the place of the form of type used in ordinary printing. But the printing method is
                  different for two reasons. The metal sheet must be moistened after every impression and before every inking because the process is
                  fundamentally lithographic. And the printing surface of the metal sheet is protected from abrasion by the "offset" method of
                  applying ink to paper:- the metal sheet prints on a rubber blanket, which transfers the image to paper. It is this last feature of
                  the complicated new technique which has given the whole process its name of "offset printing", although there are certain variant
                  techniques which print direct without the rubber blanket, and one device for omitting the moistening between impressions.</p>

               <p>New inventions and appliances in the field of offset printing are patented every month. The principal significant differences in
                  equipment, and the chief lines of technical development, are the following:</p>

                  <head>1. The Size of the Press.</head>

                  <p>The smaller presses, such as the Coxhead or Schwarz Press and the Rotaprint are better adapted for small rum work than the larger
                     presses such as the Harris Press. The larger presses do better with long runs and with color work. There are many types of offset
                     press, just as there are many types or flat-bed press, and the same company will offer models in different sizes. The large press
                     is finer, the small cheaper.</p>

                  <p>Examples of the small presses are these run by Edwards Brothers, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Mid-West Rotaprint Corporation,
                     Cleveland, Ohio; examples of the large press are those run by National Process Company, New York City and by Washington
                     Planograph co., Washington, D.C. All of these firms have collaborated in this examination of their processes.</p>

                  <head>2. The Storage of the Metal Sheets.</head>

                  <p>Some presses, as the Coxhead or Harris presses, use a rather heavy metal sheet which can be cleaned and refinished after every
                     printing. Such sheets provide a saving in that it is cheaper to clean the old than to buy a new sheet, but they affect the
                     printing costs because they make it expensive or impossible to store <pb n="20"
                        facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=41"/> the sheets for a fresh printing of a book
                     which has already been run in one edition. Rotaprint and Edwards use a thin, comparatively inexpensive metal sheet which can be
                     stored, a hundred sheets in an envelope, and used to bring out reprints. This feature of the process makes possible a greater
                     elasticity in fixing the size of an edition. The Facsimile Text Society, which has its work done on the Harris Press, prints
                     editions of 1000 even if its sales prospects do not call for that number, because once the printing has been done, no reprints
                     could be secured without making fresh plates. This tends to cause resources to be tied up in a large stock of finished books.
                     There is a similar project for the printing of small working editions of rare old English books to be used in the preparation of
                     a dictionary of 16th century English. In this project the Rotaprint type of press is used, and the editions are limited to two
                     hundred copies. But since the metal sheets can be stored, further printings can be made inexpensively, it needed.</p>

                        a photographic negative, which "fixes" the letters in bitumin and albumin upon the metal sheet. The negative may be either
                        film or paper. film is in most common use in America, but a special "Kodalith" paper is now manufactured by Eastman for use in

                     <p>In the usual photo-process the light passes through the transparent parts of a film or the white parts of Kodalith paper to
                        fix the albumin or bitumen, which will hold the ink. In the "positive" process the metal sheet is coated with a
                        light-sensitive composition which rejects ink. The photographic process thus fixes an ink-rejecting covering on the space
                        between the letters, and leaves the metal free to receive the ink. When the metal is inked the special surfacing on the
                        "white" part of the sheet is dissolved away, the sheet is moistened, and thus prepared for lithographic use, having moisture
                        in the space which is to print white, and ink in the space which is to print black. In using this positive process it is

                  <p>With a few exceptions all kinds of photography upon the albumin or bitumen compound on the metal sheet required exposures of 15
                     or 20 minutes when the negative is in contact with the metal sheet (the usual method) and 30 to 45 minutes when the image is
                     transferred by projection. An intensive search for more rapid emulsions has gone on for years. Certain firms now have secret
                     processes for speeding up the emulsion. The Copyfire Co. of Detroit is said to have cut the exposure time to three minutes, and
                     Edwards Brothers, with the help of their research department, have cut the time to one minute twenty seconds. These more highly
                     sensitized solutions are not yet standard for use in the industry. The salesmen for the Rotaprint press and process still tell

                     defective metal sheets.</p>

                  <p>a. Aquatone is a process for increasing the water-absorption of the wet parts of the sheet, to produce a clearer white in the
                     print. The same principle, without the name, is used in clearing spots or blurs in ordinary photo-lithographic printing.</p>

                  <p>b. Depth-o-tone is a trade name for a process for deepening the ink carrying parts of the plate and then filling them with
                     ink-absorbing substance; in art work it produces a deeper color, and in ordinary printing it "brings out" lines in the print
                     which would otherwise fail to register.</p>

                  <p>c. Pantone is a complicated process which is designed to make use of a principle similar to that of photo-lithography to prepare
                     a printing surface which will stand long runs and be very resistant to wear. It makes use of the fact that chromium is a hard
                     metal which will accept and transfer ink, while mercury will refuse ink. The chromium serves for the grease of <pb n="26"

                     the wet surface of the stone. Although this process will not be useful in cheapening small editions, it is interesting as an
                     illustration of the variety of techniques which can be used in printing. A sheet of iron is coated with a thin surface of copper,
                     and a very thin surface of chromium on top of the copper, and then a photographic emulsion on top of the chromium. The text is
                     transferred to the plate as in the usual photo-lithographic processes, and the parts of the metal which ordinarily receive water
                     are etched with acid through the chromium to the copper. Silver is then deposited on the plate, and the silver adheres to the
                     copper but avoids the chromium. Then mercury is rubbed over the plate, and the mercury amalgamates with the silver. The result is
                     an all-metal plate which will print without using the raised type principle.</p>

                  <p>The offset press is sometimes used, in large editions, for printing compositions which have been made with raised type, and
                     transferred to the metal sheet, either for the sake of more efficient pictorial effects, or to avoid the cost of "makeready" --
                     that is to say, the wedging up of a printing face to secure an even impression in a flat bed press. In this large-edition use the
                     photo-lithographic metal sheet is a rival of the stereotype and the electrotype. As at present organized this shop practice does
                     not enter into the calculations of small-edition manufacture. But it illustrates the fact that raised type can be completely
                     dispensed with in the printing industry if any other method than typesetting can be found for making the master-copy to be used
                     in a photo-lithographic process.</p>

                     Advertising display work is sometimes prepared by the artist who does his lettering just as he draws his pictures, and has no use
                     for type. Circulars, tabular matter, form letters, and trial editions of text books are prepared as master copy on the
                     typewriter. The limit to the application of this method to book printing is set by the unwillingness of the reader to tolerate
                     the uneven right hand margin. The third kind of master copy is the printed page which is being reprinted by the
                     photo-lithographic process.</p>

                  <p>There are two approaches to the problem of making an all-purpose master copy without using raised type. One is to improve the
                     typewriter by some method of justifying right hand margins. The other is to avoid the use of ink entirely, and photograph letters
                     in sequence upon a negative which can then be transferred directly to the metal sheet.</p>

                  <p>A modified typewriter has been developed by the Typary and Typon Company, London. This "Typary" machine sets a line of type which
                     is then automatically spaced to justify the margin, inked, and printed on a strip of paper, from which it can he transferred to
                     the photo-lithographic metal sheet. This machine has been <pb n="29"

                     metal sheets for offset printing.</p>

                  <p>The inventions which seek to "print with light" are numerous. The Dutton Photoline sets letters which a camera photographs line

                     similar invention under way. The two machines which seem to be nearest the point of practical use are the August-Hunter
                     Photocomposing Machine which is being developed in England, and the "Luminotype" invented by a Hungarian technician by the name
                     of Edmund Uher and manufactured by the Maschinenfabrik-Augsburg-Nuernburg. One model of the Uher machine had been constructed
                     when the recent financial crisis in Central Europe interrupted the venture. The Uher machine photographs a line of letters on a
                     narrow strip, and then projects from this strip, line by line, on a photographic negative. A cheap substitute for film has been

               <head>The Mimeograph and Its Relatives.</head>

               <p>The techniques of reproducing copy vary in an almost continuous sequence from the great planograph presses which use highly skilled
                  labor to produce long runs of fine color and art work to the humble mimeograph with its wax stencil prepared by a girl who has had a
                  six months' course in typewriting and its short runs of smudgy copy run off by an office boy who has learned to operate the machine
                  in half an hour.</p>

               <p>From the technical standpoint the distinctive feature is the use of a stencil cut by means of a typewriter. The sharpness of the
                  impression can be increased by improving the composition of the stencil. A.B. Dick, Chicago, and the Gestetner Duplicator,
                  Bloomfield, N.J., both offer an improved stencil with a surface which "presents much the appearance of a thin sheet of white
                  rubber."</p>

               <p>From the standpoint of performance the distinctive feature of mimeograph technique is not the stencil method but the limitation that
                  the copies are turned out in the same size as the original. From this standpoint there is very little difference between the best
                  mimeograph work <pb n="31" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=52"/> and the work done with
                  the offset press from metal sheets which have been typewritten with a special ribbon, or the work done by the Coxhead Press by
                  transferring the text direct to the metal sheet from a typescript made with a transfer ink, or even the alternative
                  semi-photographic method used in the Coxhead Press, which is described as follows:</p>

               <p>The printing is done by means of a specially prepared zinc plate on which can be transferred any kind of oririnal copy, old or new,
                  hand or typewritten...a drawing of any sort. The original is mounted on a zinc plate which has been sensitized with a special
                  solution. The plate is then exposed to the rays of an electric arc lamp for a few minutes. After this exposure the original is taken
                  off, undamaged by the process...After the plate is developed and fixed, it is etched, rubbed with a special ink and finally coated
                  with a rubber solution.</p>

               <p>The products of these different methods range above the mimeograph in quality of product according to the following scale: the
                  mimeograph with common wax stencils is lowest, the improved stencils next, the product of the Coxhead Press is next in quality, and
                  finally the offset printing from a typescript made directly on the metal sheet. But as it will appear when the application of these
                  mimeograph methods to the scholars' problem is analyzed, it is very inportant that none of then <pb n="32"

                  reduction. For the use of photography in these various techniques has two kinds of value. In the Coxhead process it copies figures,
                  signs, diagrams, and other matter which the typewriter will not cut in a stencil. In the complete photo-lithographic process it
                  accomplishes not only this service, hut also the enlargement or reduction of the page as a whole.</p>

               <p>The members of the mimeograph family have received most of their employment as office appliances, where their costs of operation
                  have been dependent upon wage scales and continuity of operation. The following quotation is the lowest that has been received for
                  mimeograph service offered commercially by an outside plant. The quotation is here given for purposes of comparison with the lowest

               <p>Some use has been made of the mimeograph stencil for duplicating catalogue cards. The Elliott Addressograph can be used for this

               <head>The Photostat and Its Relatives.</head>

               <p>The peculiarity of the photostat when it is compared with other methods of making copies of books is that the unit cost does not
                  diminish as the size of the edition increases. It is made up almost exclusively of cost of materials and running costs. The only
                  special expense which may be distributed over a number of copies is the cost of a white-on-black negative in those cases where the
                  purchasers want black-on-white positives, or where there is a saving of labor in "imposing" the negative. If one <pb n="35"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=56"/> of the purchasers is willing to accept the
                  negative copy, its cost need not always be "distributed" over the positives.</p>

               <p>The cost of materials in photostat work is the determining factor, for if that cost were greatly reduced, labor saving appliances
                  would probably come into use which would permit of an equivalent cutting of labor costs. There is some discussion of a possible new
                  photostat paper, which will use a mercury compound rather than a silver compound in the emulsion, and sell for such a low cost that
                  it compete with engraving in book illustration work. At present one must reckon with the various kinds of photostat paper sold by
                  the Photostat Corporation and its competitors.</p>

               <p>The price of ordinary photostat paper per square foot is $.042. But in the preservation of research materials use should be made of
                  the special "H" or "HH" grade of permanent paper stock, manufactured by Byron Weston Company. The "H" grade which is coated on one
                  side sells for $.052 per square foot; the "HH" grade, which is coated on both sides, and hence will bring a saving of half the cost
                  of binding the volumes, sells for $.10 per square foot of paper, or $.05 per square foot of sensitive surface.</p>

               <p>When wastage has been taken into account, and the variation due to the different ways of imposing the negative and cutting the paper
                  from rolls of different widths, has been reckoned with, the cost of materials for photostating a 100 page book in different page
                  sizes, and with different grades of paper, is as follows:</p>

               <p>To these costs of paper there must be added the costs of labor and chemicals. The New York Public Library and the printing

                  the Public Library the great majority of the prints were 11½ x 14 inches, usually one copy only, and the average cost of the paper
                  was $.055. In the Telephone Company the average size of paper was 8½ x 11, and in many cases several copies of the same object are
                  required. The cost of paper averaged $.03 per page. In the Public Library the $.055 worth of paper requires so much reference and
                  clerical work, that the cost of the finished prints rises to $.197 each. In the Telephone Company, where only operating room charges
                  need be considered, the $.03 worth of paper is worked up into a print which costs $.063. This means that the labor, depreciation and
                  chemical supplies cost $.033. These operating room costs in the Public Library amount to $.06. The figures in total operating cost

               <p>The Public Library spends an additional $.082 on every page to cover clerical help, postage, and desk supplies --charges which are
                  due to the special character of the Library work. The unescapable operating costs are 10% more than the cost of the paper, and may
                  be more than twice the cost of the paper. This percentage is reduced as the work becomes more continuous. The Life Insurance
                  Companies operate with highly standardized copy; their labor costs should be very low, but the writer has not bean able to secure
                  statements from them. The work of the Massachusetts Historical Society in copying colonial newspapers made use of the photostat at
                  its highest efficiency for the reproduction of research materials. A letter from the Director, Mr. Worthington C. Ford, explains the
                  financing of this enterprise:</p>

               <p>"...we gave our operator the highest photostat salary paid within my knowledge and with that the cost of material represented twice
                  the cost of labor. I roughly estimated that it cost us about 13¢ to make a page of a newspaper of the large size...but we printed
                  some which required the largest size of sheet adaptable to the photostat machine, and the average cost was not increased. We sold
                  the newspapers at a fixed price of 15¢ a page. Some years there was a profit of $300-$400 and some years we came out even." <pb

                  Michigan University Library and John Carter Brown Library are being carried on at a rate higher than that charged by the
                  Massachusetts Historical Society. The Library of Congress estimates that its photostat copies of foreign archive material cost it
                  15¢ each, and the British Museum and Bodleian Libraries show a cost of 6¢ a page quarto size. It can be concluded that every
                  dollar's worth of photostat paper requires from 50¢ to $1.10 in operating expenses.</p>

               <head>Photostat equipment</head>

               <p>The two appliances which compete in the field of photographic copying are the Photostat and the Rectigraph. The Photostat is the
                  older, and has succeeded in making a common noun of its trade name. The differences between the two kinds of apparatus do not seem
                  to be sufficiently important to have a decisive effect upon costs, but are worth noting because they illustrate certain of the
                  practical aspects of photostat work. Both firms have two kinds of apparatus, a standard equipment which leaves it to the operator to
                  shift the prints to a rinsing tank and to dry them, and a <pb n="40"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=61"/> "Continuous Photostat" or "Super-Rectigraph"
                  which carries the print automatically through the whole process from exposure to drying. The highest priced continuous Photostat
                  costs $4,000. The claim is made that it will turn out three prints a minute.</p>

               <p>The following are the principal differences between the two machines. The Photostat carries the print on an endless chain through a
                  developer bath, then through a chromium roller which squeezes out the surplus developer, into a rinsing tank of running water, and
                  then face-down into a shallow fixing tank which is continuously agitated by a motor. The Rectigraph apparatus grasps the end of the
                  paper and pushes it down into the developer, withdraws it up again by the same end, passes it through a roller (but not a bath of
                  running water), covers its surface with the fixing solution and lets it emerge face up in a deep fixing tank. All these features are
                  interrelated. The Rectigraph uses a deeper tank because the solution is allowed to lie still; the Photostat agitates the tank, which
                  must therefore be shallow. The Rectigraph claims that it can dispense with the agitating of the fixing bath because it covers the
                  whole surface of the paper evenly with the solution before it enters the <pb n="41"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=62"/> bath. It is this covering of the surface prior
                  to immersion in the bath which permits the print to appear face up in the tank. The Photostat has a much heavier frame, which is
                  necessary to resist the vibration caused by the agitating of the tank, but which has many independent advantages. The Rectigraph
                  wastes more paper than the Photostat because it requires more of a margin at the top of the sheet when dipping it into the
                  developer. Both companies claim that they are more saving of chemicals; in the judgment of the writer the Photostat has the better
                  claim because the developer is washed off in running water before the print enters the fixing tank. Correspondence with two users
                  who have each had experience with both types of machine reveal a preference for Photostat, partly on account of the more extensive
                  service organization.</p>

               <p>A type of equipment related to the Photostat, but making copies without camera or lens, is the "Luminiophor" radio-active plate
                  which sends out rays that penetrate an ordinary piece of white paper as if it were a transparent film, but which do not so readily
                  penetrate through an ink surface. The plate is used in a dark room, by placing the master-copy on top of the <pb n="42"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=63"/> sheet of photostat paper and the Luminiophor
                  plate on top of the master copy. The result is a contact print. The difficulty arises naturally in the case of paper which is
                  printed on both sides. Even for such pages a negative of the printing on one surface can be made by reflection, after cancelling out
                  the effect of the print on the other surface by laying the page on black paper. A true copy can then be made from the negative. The
                  Luminiophor plate must be recharged every few minutes by exposure to sunlight or strong electric or magnesium light. It sells for
                  25¢ per square inch. Its place in the scholar's equipment could only be as an aid to note taking, and even there it is inferior in
                  value to the Leica, Ansco, or Lemare equipment for making filmslide copies of documents.</p>

               <head>Collotype and Photograph.</head>

               <p>The more costly but finer relative of the photostat is the photograph, and the aristocratic cousin of the photo-lithographic process
                  is the collotype process. In collotype work a film (of gelatine) is carried on glass, or on thin sheets of metal, to become
                  reticulated under chemical and heat treatment. The gelatine receives the photographic image direct. <pb n="43"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=64"/> It reproduces the whole range of tone values of
                  the original accurately. Dr. G.B. Harrison reports that "at its best collotype can be so perfect as to need a magnifying glass to
                  detect the difference between original and counterfeit; ink can be exactly matched, and every spot, smudge and shade of color
                  exactly reproduced. One of the most brilliant examples of collotype used for book reproduction was the work of the Oxford Press some
                  thirty years ago, in their facsimile of the first Folio of Shakespeare's Plays, and I would call attention to the show-through at
                  the back of the portrait as an example of what can be done with this process. Where funds allow, collotype is for every purpose the
                  best." (G.B. Harrison: "Facsimile Reprints", a paper read before the Anglo American Conference of Historians, 13-18 Ju1y, 1931) But
                  the cost of collotyping is at least three times that of photo-lithography; it should be classed with art work rather than
                  printing.</p>

            <head>III. Comparison of the Different Methods of Book Manufacture</head>

            <p>The four fundamental techniques described above: - raised type printing, photo-lithography, mimeographing and photostating, - are all
               competitors with each other for the production of books. There is another technique - filmslide photography - which does not produce
               books at all, but which offers to the scholar a tiny roll of film as a substitute for a book. The filmslide is the competitor, not of
               any particular book production technique, but of the book itself as an instrument for the preservation of records. Before evaluating
               the filmslide process it is necessary, therefore, to review the process of book production as a whole.</p>

            <p>The technological and financial variables in book production resolve themselves into five, which should be defined relative to any item
               which it is proposed to reproduce:</p>

            <p>1. Is the material ready for photographic reproduction, or does it still require to be copied on the typewriter? (Newspapers, printed
               books, manuscripts of which facsimiles are desired,and clean typescripts can be considered as ready for the camera.)</p>

            <pb n="45" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=66"/>

            <p>2. Will the purchasers and readers demand book type and justified right hand margins, or will they accept typewriter face and uneven
               right hand margins? (Bibliophils and scholars will probably disagree on this question.)</p>

            <p>3. Does the material include other things than straight textual matter which can be tapped off on a typewriter or linotype machine?</p>

            <p>4. What degree of legibility is required?</p>

            <p>5. How many copies can be sold.</p>

            <p>These variables are all inter-dependent.</p>

                  <head>1. Reprinting Material which is Ready for Photography.</head>

                  <p>When material is ready for photography, and the problem of the use of typewriter face type is not involved, the photo-offset
                     process has no rival. The small press is preferable for editions less than one thousand, the large press (such as the Harris) is
                     able to compete in larger editions, if labor and business policies are the same.</p>

                  <p>There are two critical sizes of editions in the use of the photo-lithographic method of copying books and newspapers. There is
                     the low limit to an edition, below which the photostat is preferable; there is an optimum size of edition which will take maximum
                     advantage of the falling unit costs of production while avoiding sales risks and rising costs of promotion.</p>

                  <p>The dividing line between photostat and photo-lithography in a business establishment which uses both methods is somewhere
                     between fifteen and twenty copies. The figures quoted for commercial work are in agreement with this conclusion.</p>

                  <p>The dimensions quoted by the different photo-offset presses differ because for each size of metal sheet there are certain sizes
                     of imprint which can be made most economically, since they divide the metal sheet without wastage. The Rotaprint 17 X 11 inch
                     sheet makes two pages 8½ X 11 inches; the big Planograph sheet makes 16 pages 9 X 11½ inches, or 9 pages 12 X 15½ inches. The
                     cheapest photostat is passed by the most expensive photo-lithograph at 50 copies; the most expensive photostat is passed by the
                     cheapest photo-lithograph at 17 copies. This latter figure agrees with the office practice cited above, of changing from one
                     process to the other between fifteen and twenty copies.</p>

                  <p>These figures have practical application to a present problem in connection with certain projects for copying old newspapers by
                     the photostat method. The most successful enterprise of this kind was the one promoted by Mr. Worthington Ford, who organized the
                     copying of many colonial newspaper files. In most of his undertakings the number of subscribers ranged from fifteen to twenty
                     two, and the list never got beyond twenty four. This list therefore stood at the marginal point where photo-lithography was just
                     beginning to be <pb n="49" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=70"/> superior to the
                     photostat. Projects similar to that of Mr. Ford are under way on behalf of the John carter Brown Library at Providence, the New
                     York Historical Society and the University of Michigan. A new project is being launched by the Missouri Historical Society, and
                     an attempt is being made to reproduce the unique Chillicothe Gazette at the Ohio Historical and Philosophical Society. When
                     subscription lists to these projects rise above twenty, the photostat should be replaced with the offset press. five or ten extra
                     copies could then be made for later sale without increasing the amount the subscribers would have to pay for their sets. Twenty
                     is the critical point not only for transition from one technique to another, but also for the lowering of unit costs by
                     increasing the edition. A subscription list of forty can purchase their copies at a unit cost only half as great as must be paid
                     by a subscription list of twenty. Promoters might make use of this fact by fixing their maximum price at the photostat level but
                     offering the advantage of lower prices in the event that the subscription list grows large enough to warrant reductions.</p>

                  <pb n="50" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=71"/>

                  <p>The other critical point in the photographic copying of books is the size or edition at which the unit cost of the book equals
                     the normal prices which libraries are in the habit of paying for books. This is between 50¢ and $1.80 per hundred pages. Two
                     enterprises which illustrate the importance of this point are the project of the Facsimile Text Society and the dictionary
                     project financed with Carnegie funds under the direction of Professor Fries of the University of Michigan.</p>

                  <p>The Facsimile Text Society has 400 charter members; it has printed photo-lithographic copies of 5 books. It has 11 more books in
                     preparation, and 104 titles under consideration. The cost level at which it operates is explained in a letter from the
                     secretary:- "The cost averages about five dollars a page for one thousand copies, printed on rag paper and bound in boards. In
                     order to pay their way these books must sell at least three hundred copies."</p>

                  <p>This is a unit cost of 50¢ per 100 pages. The catalogue shows that the price to non-members is about $1.00 per hundred pages, to
                     members about 63¢. The apparent discrepancy in these figures is probably explained by the element of bindery cost, which would
                     not necessarily be <pb n="51" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=72"/> incurred for that part
                     of the edition which is printed but unsold. As has been noted in another place, the work of this society is done on one of the
                     large presses which cannot store its metal plates for a second run. The British Shakespeare Association Facsimiles are printed by
                     a similar method at a similar cost - editions of one thousand at a cost of 30¢ per 100 pages, stitched but not bound. These
                     societies print more copies than they need to sell.</p>

                  <p>A different policy is followed in the dictionary project at the University of Michigan, which calls for the copying of 400 titles
                     in editions of 200. The unit price is to be 50¢ per 100 pages, and the metal sheets are to be stored, so that later runs can be
                     made at a unit cost of about 50¢ for a second printing of 100 and 22¢ for a second printing of 500. The binding will probably be
                     less expensive than that which is used by the Facsimile Text Society.</p>

                  <p>The significant fact is that, in editions of from two to three hundred, reprints of books can be supplied at costs substantially
                     below the prices which libraries usually have to pay for average books in the open market. Even copies of old newspaper files
                     could <pb n="52" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=73"/> be sold at these low prices if
                     the subscription list could be brought to the two hundred mark. No book desired by two hundred purchasers need ever be out of
                     print.</p>

                  <p>When the possibility is once presented that books may be printed directly from a typescript, the prospect is opened for the
                     re-distribution of labor between author and publisher. In this re-distribution there may be an opportunity for great
                     economies.</p>

                  <p>In preparing copy for a printed book, the author is expected to provide a reasonably clean copy. But the editorial staff of the
                     publishing house always edits the typescript before it goes to the linotype machine. The proof must then be corrected to the
                     copy. This editorial service accounts for twenty per cent of the manufacturing cost of the book. The author must then read his
                     proofs, usually twice, once in the galley and once in the page.</p>

                  <p>How are the author's duties changed if the book is to be taken photographically from his typescript? He has the responsibility of

                     capitalization. He can easily make changes and corrections in his master copy by pasting new matter on top or the old. But once
                     he sends the sheets to the press, no further changes can be made. This has some advantages, for the labor of reading galley and
                     page proofs is eliminated. The typewriting in such work must be done with very clean type and a special dark ribbon. Erasures and
                     changes can be made if necessary. A part of a page can be pasted over the original text if an extensive change must be made.
                     Footnotes can be cut out and pasted at the button of each second page. A clean typewriter, a dark ribbon, rubber cement and
                     shears are all the tools needed in preparing typescript for reproduction. The author has a free hand to include as much
                     illustrative material or as many fac-similes as he wishes, or he may insert Chinese or Greek characters, - for the cost or
                     publishing is not affected thereby. The book which is published by photographing a typescript follows the same cost curve as the
                     photographic copy of a printed book.</p>

                  <p>The devices related to the mimeograph distribute the labor of printing more as is done in the publishing trade. The author was
                     the extra labor and the opportunity <pb n="54" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=75"/>
                     for correcting his script which proofreading affords. He cannot without great extra trouble reproduce anything which is not on
                     the typewriter keyboard, just as if he were dealing with a linotype process. These methods resemble photo-lithographing from
                     typescript chiefly in that they still leave the right hand margin ragged.</p>

                  <p>When the matter to be published contains tabulations, characters not in the Roman alphabet, diagrams or mathematical formulae,
                     the advantage of photographing the typescript increases because the cost of typesetting is much higher. Mr. Charles G. Proffitt
                     of the Columbia University Press writes: <quote red="blockquote">It has long been our judgment that much scholarly work, now
                        printed by the conventional method of typesetting, could be produced in a way that would be just as useful to the small circle
                        of readers involved and at a price substantially lower than now paid, if the work were done by the offset process from clean
                        typewritten manuscript. We published such a volume some time ago (Westermann and Kraemer - "Greek Papyri") and are urging this
                        same method in the publication of one or two other volumes at the present time. It is particularly appropriate where the use
                        of foreign characters makes the type-setting unusually expensive.</quote> Anything in the manuscript, pictorial or otherwise,
                     which cannot be pounded out on the linotype gives rise to costly hand work, and possibly to charges for zinc cuts or copper
                     plates.</p>

                  <pb n="55" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=76"/>

                  <p>The redistribution of labor between author, editor. and printer together with the elimination of special hand work in the press
                     room account for the greatest cost differences between the two methods of printing. There is another element which may mean much
                     or little - the fact that photo-lithography operates regardless of the number or words on a page, whereas linotype cost increases
                     directly with the number of words.</p>

                  <p>Two distinct typographic problems here converge - the artistic problem of the value of the straight right hand margin which the
                     linotype will supply, and the legibility problem which arises when advantage is taken of the ability of photo-lithography to
                     increase the number of words on a page by photographing typescript on a reduced scale.</p>

                  <p>At what price does the publisher purchase the aesthetic satisfaction of the justified line of type? What is the cost differential
                     between the two process? Printing costs are higher in America than abroad, but so are photo-lithographic costs. Foreign printing
                     is a little cheaper than the cheapest American photo-lithography. J. Gamber, Paris, prints 50,000 words, 100 pages in an edition
                     of 200 at a unit cost of 44¢; Edwards Brothers will make a book of the same size by photo-offset for 52½¢. If 600 words instead
                     of 500 are put on an Edwards page, the cost <pb n="56"
                        facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=77"/> per word of the two methods becomes the
                     same. It is more reasonable to compare the Edwards figure with the lowest printing quotation in this country, which, for small
                     editions, is offered by the Mime-O-Form plant. In editions of 200 to 300 its costs are exactly double those of photo-offset from
                     author's master copy. To change from a photo-lithographed typescript edition of two hundred to the cheapest book printing of
                     equivalent legibility available in this country requires that either the unit price or the size of the edition be doubled.</p>

               <head>The Cost of Legibility.</head>

               <p>In any photographic process which permits the enlargement or reduction of the size of copy - that is to say, in photostating end
                  photo-lithography - the legibility of the product is one of the variables which is strictly under control. The printer in these
                  cases is concerned with a size of page, not a number of words. The cost per word is therefore dependent upon the editor's choice of
                  a size of print, and diminishes by geometrical progression as the point size of the letters is reduced. The variation in costs is
                  illustrated if the full size typescript page be compared with a news- <pb n="57"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=78"/> paper reduced to half size. The typewritten
                  thesis, now the standard form in which unpublished scholarly work is presented, contains about 300 words on a page 8½ x 11 inches.
                  This is exactly the size of a page which will take a half size reduction of a standard newspaper. But the newspaper contains 5,000
                  to 6,000 words. Therefore the cost per word of photographic reproduction in one typographic form may be only one twentieth of the
                  cost in another form.</p>

               <p>The problem of the legibility of small type has not been thoroughly explored in its relation to the photographic methods of
                  reproduction. Much more attention has been paid to display type for advertising. A study of the effect of photo-lithographic
                  reduction on the legibility of newsprint was made by Professors Donald G. Paterson and Miles A. Tinker of the Psychology Department
                  cf the University of Minnesota, at the request of the Joint Committee on Materials for Research. Their curve of diminishing
                  legibility drops rapidly after the size of the type passes below a 50% reduction, equivalent to a 3½ point type face. There is no
                  statistically significant retardation of speed of reading when the newsprint is reduced to 80% of its full size; at 50% reduction
                  the retardation amounts to approximately half a word a second. Fatigue in reading is probably proportional to <pb n="56"

<p>These figures take no account of a number of important factors, such as length of line, and differences in type face which affect legibility. An experiment intended to supply legibility figures for typescript is under way at the University of Michigan. The table here given indicates the existence of a number of point sizes between 7 point type and 3.5 point type where reduction in cost moves faster than reduction in legibility as expressed in speed of reading.</p>

               <p>The standard typewriter equipment is such that directions for preparing typescript for photo-lithography cannot assume the
                  availability of any other type faces than the 12 point Pica and the 10 point Elite. But by using these type faces and reducing them
                  photographically, it is possible to produce finished copy in sizes all the way from 4½ points up, in a great variety of styles as to
                  length of line and spacing. Copy prepared on ordinary typewriter paper, 8½ x 11 inches, will produce a final <pb n="61"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=82"/> page having anything from 150 to 1500 words, or
                  more. The normal ten inch typewriter can also be used to prepare copy upon special large sizes or paper, thus permitting even
                  greater variety in final size and spacing of print.</p>

               <p>The small photo-offset press, which is best for small editions, works most economically upon either of two sizes of book page - 8½ x
                  11 or 5½ x 8½, (sometimes 5-7/8 x 8½). Typescript should therefore be prepared for reduction to one or these two sizes.</p>

               <p>There are three ways of preparing copy for the 8½ x 11 page.</p>

               <p>1st - to make four pages of ordinary typescript and have them reduced to half size as two columns of a page;</p>

               <p>2nd - the typescript can be copied without reduction in size;</p>

               <p>3rd - the typescript can be made in one or two columns upon a larger typing surface and then reduced to the 8½ x 11 size.</p>

               <p>Typescript for the 5½ x 8½ page is easily prepared on standard typewriter paper for any amount of reduction.</p>

               <p>The ratio of length of line to size of letter has an important effect upon legibility. A good length <pb n="62"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=83"/> is N x 30 where N is the point size of the
                  type. it this rate the optimum length for a line of Pica type is about five inches, and of Elite type four inches. If the ordinary
                  double spacing is wider than necessary, and single spacing too crowded, another spacing is given to a typescript by using a special
                  ratchet which can be attached to the typewriter to set the lines one and one third spaces apart. Each combination of length of line,
                  size of type, spacing and reduction ratio yields its result in number of words per page, and hence in cost of reproduction. The
                  costs are here tabulated; the legibility factor has not yet been worked out. The styles which are marked with a star are reproduced
                  in the appendix.</p>

               <p>There are two inquiries remaining to be made in connection with legibility. The psychological study should be carried further to
                  compare typescript and print faces of various sizes and densities till all the unnecessary variables are excluded, three or four
                  levels of legibility are identified, and the maximum number or words per page together with the optimum typescript format are
                  determined for each level of legibility. The users of research material must then decide what legibility they want in each class of
                  material, taking into account such things as probability of frequent consultation, or the likelihood that the reader will wish to
                  skim the entire text as against the likelihood that he will merely search for a particular item. The small type in the dictionary is
                  not fatiguing to the reader because so little is read at a stretch. In copying printed material, whether it be in the form of book,
                  periodical or newspaper, the requirements of the small press will always favor certain page sizes, and the requirements of the
                  scholar certain type sizes. If a typescript, a duodecimo volume in 5 point type and a great folio in 12 point type have the same
                  kind of utility in research, the reprinting should enlarge the one and reduce the other to whatever size has the <pb n="65"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=86"/> appropriate legibility. A certain rule of thumb
                  accuracy in making decisions about size of type can be achieved without setting a standard, but standards of legibility if defined
                  would aid both editors and promoters. The editor would know at once, when he had decided upon a standard of legibility, what kind of
                  printing technique would fulfill that standard. And the promoter would be able to inform prospective subscribers accurately upon
                  this important aspect of his project. In connection with the copying of newspaper files the question is already presented. Some
                  librarians want full size copies, and others believe that the pages should be reduced. But how far is the reduction to be carried?
                  There is no advantage to choosing a fixed percentage and reducing everything by that amount, for some newspapers are close to the
                  low limit of legibility in their original size. The promoter should be able to say that the copies to be furnished will have a
                  certain legibility, so that the subscriber will know exactly what he is subscribing for. The prospective users should have an
                  opportunity to say whether they would prefer to have one newspaper file made accessible to them in seven point type or four files in
                  three and one half point type.</p>

               <head>Optical Aids to Legibility.</head>

               <p>When the size of the type face is cut down in order to reduce the price of a volume or ut down the number of copies which must be
                  sold, the point is ultimately reached where reading glasses may be useful to assist the naked eye. The optical principles of the
                  reading glass are such that every increase in magnifying power diminishes the area of the field of vision. No practicable magnifying
                  system will do more than double the ostensible size of the type without introducing disagreeable distortion at the edges of the
                  field, or unduly diminishing the field of vision. There is no such thing as a really "high power" reading glass. The most convenient
                  kind of optical aid to the reading of small type is the half-cylinder of glass which is mounted on short runners which hold it about
                  an inch above the page. This apparatus magnified the letters only in the dimension of height, but lends itself more easily than the
                  round reading glass to the rapid skimming of a page. When the limitations of the reading glass are considered in connection with the
                  technical difficulty of reducing print to sizes much below 3.5 points, it is clear that there is no advantage in making a text which
                  cannot be read with the <pb n="67" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=88"/> naked eye. The
                  aid of the reading glass and its variants should be saved for the use of those whose eyes are subnormal, or who find themselves
                  obliged to read continuously in print which is only suited for short stretches of reading. A reader who merely looks up an article
                  in a 3.5 point newsprint page will not need optical aid, but a man who is going through an entire file of the newspaper may have use
                  for one of these glasses.</p>

               <head>The Fiskoscope</head>

               <p>The Fiskoscope, invented by Admiral Fiske, is a magnifying glass intended to render possible the reduction of print to the point
                  where reading with the naked eye is impossible. Typescript or other reading matter is reduced seven diameters in the offset press
                  and printed in thin strips. 3 x 8½ inches, each strip containing 45 small squares of 165 typescript words each, a total of over 7400
                  words, equivalent to maximum number of 50% reduced newsprint words which the offset press can put on a page 8½ x 11 inches. The
                  strip of finely printed paper is fixed in a movable frame in front of the magnifying glass, the glass is set at a fixed focus which
                  suits the reader's eye, and the printed matter is then moved through the frame by <pb n="68"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=89"/> turning a little screw.</p>

               <p>To a person not trained to use one eye alone. the Fiskoscope is very tiring. It is difficult to use in reading normal pages because
                  the field of vision is too small. The special pages of 165 words each were typewritten to permit the whole page to be seen at once,
                  but in reading a page of the New York Times, reduced 6 diameters, the restriction of the field of vision precludes skimming and is
                  very annoying. If the principle of the Fiskoscope is to enter usefully into the scholar's equipment, it must be keyed in with
                  filmslide photography rather than with offset printing, for it calls for a departure from the book form. Admiral Fiske writes that
                  the limit upon the magnifying power of his instrument is fixed by the printers, who cannot provide him with copy any smaller than
                  newsprint reduced six diameters. But the filmslide negative will reduce newsprint more than twenty diameters. The place for such an
                  instrument as the Fiskoscope is as an auxiliary to the projector in the use of filmslides,-- a use which will be discussed
                  below.</p>

                  committee has printed its report in a pamphlet available at its office, 26-27 Bedford Square, London,(ls). In both investigations it
                  was recognized that several degrees of permanence in paper must be standardized. The British classification is as follows:</p>

               <p>Grades I and II are distinguished in the English report by the nature of the raw material used and the price level at which they can
                  be furnished, in the American Bureau of Standards report by a computed life-probability and performance in oven-aging. The American
                  Rag Paper Manufacturers hold with the British Library Association in favor of raw materials as the criterion of probable durability;
                  the U.S. Government Printing Office uses Bureau of Standards "performance" specifications, which are "revolutionary" in business
                  practise. In the following tables of specifications it is to be noted that "Alpha Cellulose" is derived either from rags or wood
                  pulp. The opposition between the two methods of grading, by raw-materiel composition and by performance, is clear:</p>

                     have an alpha content of around 90 per cent, while those from new rags have as high as 98 per cent. Therefore papers in Grade I
                     may be made of the best of new rags, degraded or worn rags, the best of purified wood pulps or a mixture of good rags and an
                     inferior wood pulp. Price and permanence qualities within this range will necessarily vary widely.</p>
                  <p>"Copper number. The best of wood pulp normally carries a copper number several times as large as that of similarly purified rag
                     stock. While new rag papers show copper numbers of .15 to .75, wood pulp papers vary from 1.0 for alpha pulp to 2.5 for ordinary
                     sulphite. The range of permanence possibilities for papers of copper number less than 1.5 is even wider than that of the alpha
                     content specified....</p>
                  <p>"Oven aging accelerates the action of certain impurities in paper and indicates in a conveniently short time the possible slow
                     degradation of paper from such impurities. At the temperature chosen this dark heat has no effect on pure fibers whether of wood
                     or rag and it gives no indication of their relative resistance to atmospheric impurities. At a temperature of 135 C instead of
                     100 C rag papers are decidedly more permanent than wood papers."</p>

               <p>It must be concluded that the scientific classification of papers according to permanence is still a highly contentious subject, in

               <p>Although some of the rag paper manufacturers will not bid on the Bureau of Standards specifications, American Writing Paper Company
                  quotes 35¢ a pound for Grade I, and 22¢ a pound for Grade II. The cost of quality is figured differently on the British scale.
                  Taking normal book paper prices as 1, their quotation for the Grade I papers is 3 to 6, and for Grade II papers 1.</p>

               <p>The American Rag Paper Manufacturers suggest a different price index in a letter of November 17, 1931, which is of special interest
                  because it expresses the considered opinion of the industry:</p>

               <p>A meeting was held with representatives of the various mills making permanent book papers in order to discuss the request in your

                     into paper permanence is not sufficiently well defined for them to adopt an adequate uniform set of specifications, and therefore
                     the permanent book papers offered by these mills differ as to details of quality and price.... </p>
                  <p>Some papers made of cheap, impermanent materials may command a reasonably high price because of some attractive feature as color,
                     surface, finish, bulk, weight, printability, etc., while the less attractive permanent papers are selling for less price. A price
                     limit which a buyer might construe as defining the permanence of paper could obviously lead to serious error.</p>
                  <p>A price limit, however, together with a few carefully chosen specifications which will qualify the price as being due to
                     permanence quality rather than some appearance effect they consider as highly desirable...</p>

               <p>A paper cost differential or 7¢ per volume if the whole edition is sold out will rise to 43¢ per volume if the edition is expected
                  to pay its way with the sale of 300 copies. A paper cost differential of 26½¢ per volume if the whole edition is sold out will rise
                  to 88¢ if only 300 copies of the edition are sold. It is the storage of expensive paper in unsold books that makes it so costly to
                  print on high priced paper. The financing of permanent paper reduces itself to the problem or how to avoid print- <pb n="76"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=97"/> ing more than can be sold. In offset printing
                  this means that the key to paper quality is the use in printing of a metal sheet that can be stored for later printings. This
                  applies to all non-commercial enterprises.</p>

               <p>In ordinary commercial publishing the risk of printing a large number of copies that will not be sold must be taken, for the
                  possibility of profit depends upon the smaller unit costs of books in large editions. The practicable way to finance high quality
                  paper in books published commercially would appear to be in the printing of one or two hundred copies of fine paper for sale to
                  libraries. But such printings, when made, are usually sold at luxury prices. The publishers say they cannot afford to stock two
                  qualities of paper at approximately the same price because of the extra stock-room cost. It is possible that libraries could secure
                  a block of books printed on special paper at no higher cost than the added cost of the paper if they were organized to give the
                  publisher the order in one block, so that there would be no stock-room cost. Any organization of libraries which had purchasing
                  power sufficient to reprint new editions at will could probably arrange to secure special paper in many commercially printed
                  books.</p>

               <p>The influence of size of edition upon the cost of using higher priced papers is very marked, for the smaller the edition, the
                  smaller is the proportion of its cost due to paper. This fact reinforces the argument that small editions printed with the certainty
                  that all copies will be sold can be produced upon the most durable paper without greatly adding to their cost.</p>

               <p>The interests of research in the reproduction of material are of two kinds, an interest in the present and interest in the future.
                  From the standpoint of the present it is important to give the scholars of today an equipment which they can use with greatest
                  economy of effort. The disadvantage of having material reproduced in small type must be balanced against the advantage of having it
                  available on the spot. The sacrifice of artistic values in the use of typescript must be weighed against the gain of a greater
                  freedom from financial restrictions in publishing research work and material. The further research proceeds in the direction of
                  specialization, the more limited will be the circle of readers interested in any particular item of research <pb n="78"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=99"/> material. Unsubsidized publication has hitherto
                  financed itself on the possibility that the circle of purchasers would reach two thousand; technological conditions permit a new
                  basis - the certainty that the circle will reach one hundred. Scholars in any field of study in the social sciences and humanities
                  which can organize their group of one or three hundred purchasers who are able to pay normal book prices for materials in the field
                  can escape from financial limitations upon the circulation of any materials that are deemed important.</p>

               <p>The same organization of purchasing and production would also care for the interests of the future, for publication on permanent
                  papers could be guaranteed.</p>

               <p>It is not to be expected that there could be found one hundred institutions, each able to subscribe for all worthy ventures in
                  publication by and for scholars. Perhaps not more than five or six institutions in the country have the resources which would permit
                  them to specialize in everything. For libraries themselves must specialize and farm out their work, and leave it to liberal lending
                  policies to make up the difference between a particular equipment and a particular need. The group of subscribers who will fill in
                  files of reproductions of <pb n="79" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=100"/> Colonial
                  newspapers will probably not interest themselves in reproductions of contemporary European newspapers; those who went to buy a copy
                  of every reprinted book of 16th century English may be indifferent to the problem of filling in the gaps in the collection of the
                  statutes of the American States. As things stand at present, the organization of the market has lagged far behind the development of
                  technical processes of reproduction.</p>

               <p>The great libraries, - such as Harvard, Library of Congress, New York Public Library, - will not always be the purchasers of
                  reprints of old materials, for they may be in possession of original copies. Younger and poorer libraries may often be the ones
                  which provide the purchasing power for a reprinting enterprise. As an illustration of this situation, the Miller Diary can serve.
                  This is a set of twenty volumes of sources on the Paris Peace conference. It was printed in an edition of 40 copies only - a
                  restriction which is regretted by Mr. Miller, who financed the publication and gave the volumes to libraries free of charge. Only a
                  few of the libraries in America possess this important set. It is technically possible to reprint it in an edition of 300 to be sold
                  to other libraries at $2.50 per volume, or fifty dollars the <pb n="80"

                  medium sized libraries which were not able to secure a copy of the original edition.</p>

               <p>Organization of purchasing groups in their respective fields of interest is the next step in liberating book production from
                  financial restrictions. But there is another possibility - that the book as the vehicle of reproduction for a very narrow circle may
                  find itself superseded by the filmslide. The range of usefulness of the filmslide will be considered in the next chapter.</p>

            <head>IV. Filmslide Photography</head>
            <p>The reduction of a text to microscopic proportions on a photographic film or plate may enter into two entirely different schemes for
               the reproduction of research material. It may be a means of imposing a negative in the making of a full-size photostatic copy, and
               hence a mere variant of book-manufacture by the photostatic process. Or it may be a device which is independent of book manufacturing,
               and which will put before the scholars' eyes an image of a text projected on a screen, rather than the tangible page of a book.</p>
            <p>When the filmslide is used as a step in the photostat process the technique of photostating is changed, but the cost level is still
               about the same. The cost of the negative is minimal, the apparatus for taking the negative is light and easily portable, and it is
               possible to store the negative for a long period and then enlarge it as a full size positive print when there is need for it, or when
               money is available. This is the way in which Mr. Worthington Ford plans to use filmslides in collecting copies of foreign archive
               material for the Library of Congress. But in this project the making of filmslides has far outrun the work of transferring them to full
               size sheets of photostat paper. In the meantime the film- <pb n="82"
                  facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=103"/> slides themselves are being read by the
               projection method. It is this latter process that promises the most sweeping changes in the cost level at which research material can
               be reproduced.</p>
            <p>All types of equipment now available for filmslide reproduction of materials make use of standard positive motion picture film, 35 mm.
               wide. Although there are experiments in the motion picture industry looking toward the use of wider film strips, this size must for the
               present he assumed to be standard. There are two kinds of material out of which the film is made - a nitrate and an acetate base. The
               former is considered more perishable, and is certainly more inflammable. The acetate film is the only kind which should be used. Until
               recently it was sold by Eastman for 2¢ a foot, then Dupont cut the price to 1¢, and Eastman came down to 1½¢. The size of the surface
               of the film which can be used depends upon whether it is perforated or unperforated. If the film is perforated to meet the mechanical
               requirements of moving picture cameras and many other kinds of apparatus, only 25 mm. of the strip is available for photography. If the
               film is unperforated this amount is increased to 30 mm. A <pb n="83"
                  facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=104"/> square metre of sensitive surface is furnished by
               108 feet of unperforated film, or 132 feet of perforated. An unperforated strip six feet three inches long, or a perforated strip eight
               feet three inches long, will provide a square foot of photographic surface.</p>
            <p>It has been noticed that as the processes verge from the typographic toward the photographic, the size of the edition becomes less
               significant as a controlling element in costs, and the size of the letters becomes more important. The extreme case of cost reduction
               through reducing the size of the letters is filmslide photography. The square foot of surface, which costs less than ten cents, will
               photograph 100 square feet of print reduced to one tenth its original size, or 400 square feet reduced to one twentieth. If the
               reduction ratio be expressed as a whole number, the amount of text that can be reproduced on a given quantity of film will increase as
               the square of the reduction ratio. A fifty page issue of the New York Times covers with print two hundred and seventy square feet of
               paper surface. It sells for three cents on the street. Photographed full size it will cover eighty six dollars worth of photostat
               paper; reduced twenty <pb n="84" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=105"/> four diameters it
               will go on three cents worth of film.</p>
            <p>The question is therefore raised at the outset: what reduction ratios are practicable when printed matter is to be photographed on
               small film and read by projection? The physical limit to reduction is certainly the resolving power of the film. This may be as high as
               90 lines to the millimeter, but is usually 50. (Otto Sandvik, "On the Measurement of Resolving Power of Photographic Materials",
               Proceedings of the Seventh International Congress of Photography, July 1928) It is affected by a number of variables, notably the
               wave-frequency of the light and the length of exposure, the quality of the emulsion, (especially the fineness of its grain), and the
               method of developing. Dr. Miller Reese Hutchinson has worked out a treatment to increase the resolving power of film by giving it an
               extra bath before developing it. The commercial value of his invention will probably be exploited in the making of sound film, where
               high resolving powers are of supreme importance. In the development of increased resolving power, as in its choice of film, filmslide
               photography is a very obscure beneficiary of the motion picture industry.</p>
            <p>The standard scientific measure of resolving power is in lines per millimeter. But this proves to be <pb n="85"
                  facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=106"/> too refined a measurement for studying the
               practical usefulness of apparatus on the market, under normal shop or library conditions. Since the final term in the whole process is
               legibility of material, a rough index of legibility of product can be used to make possible the comparison of the efficiency of the
               different filmslide cameras. If a page of seven point newsprint type is reduced R diameters on the filmslide, and projected on a
               screen, the different degrees of legibility of the screen image can be set apart as follows:</p>
            <p>"A" Legibi1ity - all letters distinct. The projected image at "A" legibility may be rendered more easily legible than the original
               text, for it can be increased to a larger size.</p>
            <p>"B" Legibility - The edges of the letters begin to blur. The loss in clearness compensates for any increase in size. But the letters

               film. Imposed in this way the 50 page issue of the Times would require a little more than three feet of film. With unperforated film a
               reduction of twenty diameters would just serve to lay the page crosswise on the film. There would be no advantage in increasing the
               reduction ratio beyond 20 for unperforated film, or beyond 24 for perforated, unless it were raised to 36 or 30 diameters, at which
               point it would be possible to lay a complete spread of the newspaper across the film strip. At these higher reductions the fifty pages
               would go on as little as sixteen inches of film, costing less than two cents, but the legibility under best conditions would drop to

               <head>Cinescope - Photoscope</head>

               <p>A Belgian company which began operations several years ago sought to sell films "microphote" de la Photoscopie as a cheap but
                  efficient substitute for glass slides used in art study and visual education. It issued a catalogue of geographic, religious,
                  scientific and artistic subjects, and sought to interest the historical associations and library associations of Europe in its use
                  as a preserver of pictorial and documentary material. The Photoscope went out of business, to be succeeded by La Cinescopie, Rue aux
                  Laines, Brussels. Then the name became Photoscope again, and the address <pb n="91"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=112"/> changed to 121 Rue Berckmans, Brussels.</p>

               <p>There are no Cinescopes in America, a fact which the company explains as due to the rush of European orders. The description of the
                  camera is given as "most portable, being only 9½ x 4½ x 6 cm." "The shutter makes possible all exposures". "The actual film carrier
                  takes a length of three meters standard cinema film", which means 120 pictures. "A holder containing more films is contemplated for
                  those who wish to take as many as 500 or more views on a single film. The camera can be fastened to any photo-stand". The projector
                  can be fastened to a stand and used to project downward on a table.</p>

               <p>The manager of the Cinescopie wrote in February, 1931 that he would make a test exposure of a page of the New York Times sent him
                  for the purpose, but he has not since been heard from. There is no evidence that this apparatus possesses any superior technical
                  qualities which should cause it to be ranked above the products of the Ansco or Leitz companies, which are sponsored by sales
                  organizations in America, or the Lemare outfit, which has been amply proved by its work in the collection of archive copies for the
                  Library of Congress.</p>
            </div>
            <pb n="92" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=113"/>
            <div type="section">
               <head>The Ansco Universal Still-Film Copying Camera</head>

               <p>The Cinescope was developed to meet a demand for illustrative material for lectures, and this same need brought into existence the
                  copying camera sold by the Agra Ansco corporation, Binghamton, N.Y., for fifty dollars. One of these cameras was loaned to the Joint
                  Committee for test and examination. The lens is mounted on a frame facing a copy board which can be clamped in position at any
                  distance up to three feet from the lens. The copy board will hold a sheet 11 x 14 inches, which is the largest size that can be
                  photographed conveniently with this apparatus on the single-frame filmslide (23 x 18 mm.). In back of the lens two chambers are
                  mounted, one with a ground glass back for focusing, the other holding the film for exposure. There is no shutter attachment;
                  exposure is made by removing a little cap from the lens. In operating the equipment the original is fastened to the vertical copy
                  board, the ground glass is moved opposite the lens and the lens sleeve turned to bring the object into focus. If the copying is
                  fine, a microscope must be used in adjusting the focus. When the lens is correctly set, the opening must be stopped down to increase
                  the fineness of the <pb n="93" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=114"/> image, then the cap
                  is put over the lens, and the film chamber moved behind it. Exposure of 10 to 25 seconds is necessary with two forty watt electric
                  lights.</p>

               <p>The Ansco copying camera is very easy to load. The film cartridge is simply a wooden box into which the film has been pushed through
                  a narrow felt-lined slit. A loading consists of 50 exposures, or three feet of film. The disadvantage of the loading system as
                  compared with Leica equipment is the absence of any signal to show when the fifty exposures have been used up. Another noteworthy
                  point is the cost of the film if it is bought as recommended in cartridges of fifty exposures. These are sold by Ansco for fifty
                  cents, although the film in them can be bought for three or five cents. The user can avoid this charge by loading the little film
                  boxes himself.</p>

               <p>Another difficulty in the use of the Ansco equipment arises from the vertical position of the copy board. It would not be difficult
                  to make some kind of a glass covered book holder with a spring back to hold book pages flat against the glass, but at present no
                  such equipment is offered by Ansco. In its absence the difficulty of copving a page from a book is very great. Loose <pb
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=115 p.94"/> sheets are clamped in place on the board
                  by means of some spring steel clamps, but the clamps sometimes fail to hold. Focusing with a microscope is a very awkward task. It
                  must be concluded that although the Ansco equipment is devised for the sole object of permitting easy and cheap copying of pages, it
                  has faults which cameras built for more general use do not have. These faults could be rectified by the manufacturer without great
                  trouble. The two needs are:</p>

               <p>1. A more efficient copy holder. A purchaser could probably construct this himself.</p>

               <p>2. A signalling device to indicate when the chamber is emptied of film.</p>

               <p>Loading the Ansco is easier than loading the Leica.</p>

               <p>The advantage of the Ansco as compared with the Leica and Lemare cameras is to be found principally in the lower purchase price and
                  the smaller frame of film used. The latter is an advantage only to the extent that Ansco focusing will permit the copying of a page
                  or spread on one frame. Thus if one were copying a pamphlet 5½ x 7 inches, he could put two pages on one frame in either Ansco or
                  Leica. But the Leica frame is twice as large as the Ansco, and the cost of materials would therefore be twice as high. But if <pb

               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>Focusing</head>

                  <p>The Leitz Company has not manufactured a camera for specialized service in copying. It offers rather a large variety of
                     attachments which adapt its general-purpose camera to copying needs. The Ansco also has its general purpose camera and a way of
                     using it on a copying stand, but this combination is not as good as the special Ansco Copying Camera. Therefore the "universal"
                     Leica with its attachments should be compared with the special Ansco camera.</p>

                  <p>The newest attachment offered by the Leitz Company (costing $12.00 to $25.00) makes its copying equipment resemble the Ansco in
                     that the camera containing film is moved away from the lens to permit focusing on ground glass, and then moved back to position
                     behind the lens to permit exposure. But this kind of focusing has little special value when the image is as small as the image of
                     print reduces to <pb n="96" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=117"/> the size or a
                     filmslide. It is still necessary to use a magnifying glass in focusing. The standard Leica equipment adjusts the focus by
                     measuring the distance from camera to object, computing size of object that will be recorded at that distance, and turning the
                     lens sheath on a callibrated scale.</p>

               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>Copy Holding.</head>

                  <p>All the Leica and Lemare copying stands hold the camera above a copy which lies flat on the table. The difficulty of clamping a
                     sheet to a vertical copy stand is avoided. A glass plate can be laid on top of the object to flatten it. The Lemare copystand is
                     superior to the Leica, especially in its attachment for photographing pages from bound books. The Leica copystands are of two
                     kinds. There is a light portable one which is easily dismounted and put into a canvas kit bag. There is the heavier and more
                     rigid stand used in common for the copying and enlarging processes. As the apparatus is offered by the Leitz company, the
                     purchaser gets his choice between rigidity and portability. Professor Gehlke, of Western Reserve University, has contrived an
                     inexpensive modification of the rigid enlarging stand to make it dismountable and portable.</p>

               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>Double Exposure.</head>

                  <p>The Leitz Company offers two kinds of cameras: <pb n="97"
                        facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=118"/> the one with focal plane shutter at $91.50
                     and the "Compur Shutter" at $72. The difference in shutters is important only in connection with fast exposures, and does not
                     affect copying work. It happens quite by accident that the cheaper Compur shutter is better for copying, because the film winding
                     device works independently of the shutter, and permits a double exposure on the same slide. This double exposure possibility,
                     ordinarily an embarrassment, may offer a way of saving film by taking two pictures on one slide. A piece of black felt can be
                     laid down over the area in focus; a book can be laid down over one half of the space, and one exposure made, photographing two
                     pages; then the book can be moved over to the other half of the space, and another exposure can take the next two pages. Thus
                     four pages of a pamphlet can be put on one slide. Used in this way, the double frame camera such as the Leica or Lemare can do
                     the work of the single frame camera such as the Ansco.</p>

               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>Loading.</head>

                  <p>The load taken by the Leica camera is 5¼ feet of film, 36 exposures, as compared with three feet, 50 exposures in the Ansco; 8 to
                     10 feet, 50 to 80 <pb n="98" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=119"/> exposures in the
                     Q.R.S., and 16½ feet, 100 exposures in the Lemare. In Ansco and Leica the film is loaded into a cartridge in the dark room, and
                     the cartridge then inserted in the camera by daylight; the Lemare camera is taken into the dark room and loaded direct.
                     Convenience is on the side of the maximum amount of film in one loading, and hence favors the Lemare.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Filmograph and Kennedy Apparatus</head>

               <p>If Cinescope, Ansco, Leica and Lemare have been designed to fill needs more or less closely related to those of a scholar, teacher
                  or librarian, the Filmograph and Kennedy machines have been developed without any reference to the needs of the academic world. And
                  yet they may turn out to be better suited than any other equipment to scholarly uses. In Seattle, Washington, Carl E. Lundberg and
                  H. C. Lambach have developed a machine called the "Filmograph" for copying court house records for abstracting companies. Mr. Lloyd
                  B. Kennedy in Warren, Ohio has invented a similar machine which he uses for the same purpose. Both of these machines are much larger
                  than the other types, and are intended to work faster, making longer runs. They both take full 400 foot rolls of film. The Kennedy
                  appa- <pb n="99" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=120"/> ratus is focused by trial and
                  error to pick up the chemical focus, which is different from the optical focus when very short wave length light is used. The
                  focusing need be done only once for a job of copying hundreds of volumes. A volume of records is placed in a glass-covered copy
                  holder; the attendant presses down the glass cover which releases the camera shutter. An electric motor opens the shutter for the
                  exact exposure time required. When the exposure has been made a bell rings, which notifies the attendant that he may raise the
                  glass, turn a page, and press down the cover again. The Filmogreph is similar, but does not photograph through glass, and does not
                  seem to have so fine a focusing system. Both machines, it is claimed; work very fast. The Filmograph claims that it can make forty
                  exposures a minute, and copy a 640 page volume of legal records in twenty minutes. The Filmograph which is set up in Washington, D.
                  C. to copy some land office records to replace those destroyed by fire in North Dakota can make 5,000 negatives, recording 10,000
                  pages, in a day. An independent observer has noticed that the actual daily produce is about half of that - 2,500 exposures, 5,000
                  pages per day.</p>

               <p>The advantage of these larger machines is in <pb n="100"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=121"/> their saving of labor. Dr. Thomas Martin, who
                  supervises the use of the Lemare equipment in the Library of Congress, calculates that two or three operators assisting each other
                  could run off 5,000 prints with a Lemare camera as easily as one operator could make the 5,000 negatives on the Filmograph. The
                  Kennedy machine is certainly as fast as the Filmograph.</p>

               <p>The commercial exploitation of these machines has so far been based upon competition with typescript or photostat copying for
                  abstract offices. Kennedy charges 35¢ per foot of finished film; Filmograph suggests the rather complicated arrangement that the
                  machine could be leased for a flat monthly charge of $50, and in addition to the leasing charge a royalty charge of 2¢ for each two
                  inches of film, "with the understanding that we furnish the film at no additional cost to the lessee, but that the developing
                  expense be borne by the lessee" - a royalty of 4¢ per foot of film. The going price for developing is approximately 3¢ per running
                  foot. Neither of these arrangements are suited to the library price level. But it must be understood that both prices are set in
                  rather arbitrary independence of costs, and in ignorance of the <pb n="101"

                  research can be developed.</p>

               <p>Both Filmograph and Kennedy evince an interest in developing the research materials field. Mr. W.K. Shissler, a Filmograph

               <head>Comparison of Efficiencies in Reduction.</head>

               <p>Although in theory the length of exposure and manner of developing have a very great importance in determining the limit of
                  reduction, fineness of focus is the only contribution to a high reduction ratio that can be made by the camera equipment itself.
                  Experiments under non-laboratory conditions show that fineness of focus is in fact the principal limiting factor. The difference
                  between the result of an exposure made with the lens stopped to 6.3 and one made with the stop at 18 is very great, but the
                  difference due to varying lengths of exposure is small. The finest work has been done by the Kennedy apparatus which, it happens,
                  employs an unusually accurate focusing device. Therefore it is permissible to compare the performance of cameras with <pb n="103"

               <p>The Eastman laboratories concluded on theoretical grounds that the limit of reduction should be about 25 diameters, and made a test
                  of this reduction ratio, which had D legibility. The superiority of the Leica to the Lemare may be due to the extra front lens used
                  in the <pb n="104" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=125"/> Leica in copying work. The
                  superior work of the Kennedy apparatus may be due to the use of short wave-length light and exceptional equipment for focusing. Any
                  apparatus on the market (except the Q.R.S.) will take care of work which requires a reduction of no more than fifteen diameters. The

               <head>Projection Apparatus</head>

               <p>The weak point in the technique of filmslide reproduction is not the camera but the projector. The writer has tested the Leica and
                  Spencer Lens Co. projectors, loaned to the Joint Committee for the purpose. Both these projectors when used with newsprint reduced
                  18 diameters will delineate clearly only about one-third or one-half of the material on the screen. If the center is brought into
                  focus, the text at the edge of the screen will be blurred; if the text at the edge is brought into focus, the center will blur. The
                  two projectors, Leica and Spencer, do not vary significantly in this respect. The Spencer Delineascope stands a little further from
                  the screen, and makes a brighter image than the Leica machine, but has a coarser focal adjustment. The film holder of the Leica
                  projector can be turned around to <pb n="105" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=126"/>
                  show either the side or top of the frame uppermost. No filmslide increased or diminished in legibility when it was shifted from the
                  one to the other projector.</p>

               <p>Both projectors are hot to the touch, but the heat does not seem to damage the film. Filmslides left in the projector for fifty-four
                  hours continuously showed no ill effects, although throughout this time they were in direct contact with hot glass. The Filmograph
                  organization offers a special projector called the Filmoscope, which is said to project the image evenly over the whole screen,
                  without blurring at the edges. The writer has not had an opportunity to test this device. The Kennedy projector is a modification of
                  the Leica, and the projector used in the Library of Congress a modification of the Spencer Delineascope. In each of these projectors

                  sheet of ground glass. The Filmograph projector works from a mounting above the reader's head, and is read by reflected light direct
                  from the screen. Experiments with diff- <pb n="106" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=127"

                  screen. An image reflected from white blotting paper is a trifle more legible than one reflected from the ordinary silver screen.
                  But between the reflection from the silver screen and transmission through focusing glass there is no significant difference.</p>

               <p>Filmslides of normal-size printed or manuscript pages, which in the case of non-perforated film are reductions of seven to ten
                  diameters only, are legible by means of a powerful reading lens. The reading system designed for this purpose by Dr. Thomas Martin
                  consists of two elements: a ground glass stand illuminated from below which transmits light through a film negative laid upon it,
                  and a lens fixed at the correct focal distance from the plans of the glass. The reader merely passes the film over the ground glass.
                  The Fiskoscope could be used for reading positive paper prints of filmslides, but the principle of the Martin apparatus is

               <head>Choice Among Makes of Equipment on the Market.</head>

               <p>If filmslide photography is to attain its maximum usefulness, there must be a standardization of equipment which will make rolls of
                  filmslide easily interchangeable among institutions using them. The most important choice to be made in this connection lies between
                  the use of the perforated and non-perforated film. Since the nonperforated film provides 30% more of sensitive surface than the
                  perforated, the argument would be all in favor of its use, were it not that the camera on the market does not seem to do as fine
                  work as would be expected of it.</p>

               <p>The best small camera and equipment now on the market which uses the non-perforated film is undoubtedly the "E.K.A." Lemare. But it
                  is so far inferior to the Leica in resolving power that it loses the advantage of the extra 20% of film. Leica will reproduce 45
                  centimeters with "A" legibility on a 25 millimeter breadth of film; Lemare will give the same legibility to no more than 39
                  centimeters on its 30 millimeter breadth of film.</p>

               <pb n="108" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=129"/>

               <p>The Leica equipment is also likely to be more useful in meeting the wishes of individual scholars. The camera can be used for all
                  kinds of photography, the copying service being only a small part of its general usefulness. The equipment offered by the Leitz
                  company is so varied that the purchaser will buy only so much of the outfit as will be necessary to meet his individual
                  requirements. A sociologist may wish to copy statistical material and take pictures of housing conditions; an anthropologist may
                  wish to use the camera outdoors for scenes of life among the savages and indoors for making pictures of small ertefacts as well as
                  copies of pages of materials that are difficult of access. Someone travelling in Europe may wish to copy a few books, documents, or
                  newspapers and use the same camera for making a photographic record of his vacation. The Ansco apparatus has no advantage other than
                  its somewhat lower first cost. If the Library is equipped with a projector for Lemare films, the owner of a Leica or Ansco will be
                  able to read his own films on that projector, or borrow the films of some other Ansco or Leica owner and read them without
                  additional investment. It is to be hoped that someone <pb n="109"

               <p>In the cost of film-slide reproduction there is a factor analagous to that which affects the cost of photo-lithographic reproduction
                  - the possible variety in the ways of distributing labor between the scholar and the technical workshop. If the filmslide camera is
                  being used by an individual to collect material, it is likely that he will make the exposures himself. The filmslide copies will be
                  his substitutes for notes. The cost per foot of film plus the cost of commercially developing the negative will be 3½¢ per foot or
                  4¢ to allow for wastage of film. For this cash expenditure the scholar will receive 17 Ansco single frame slides, 7 Leica or Q.R.S.
                  double frame slides, or 6 Lemare nonperforated double frame slides. All of these prices are less than normal book costs.</p>

               <p>The experience of the Library of Congress shows that when the labor cost of making the exposures with Lemare equipment at the
                  leisurely rate of 100 per day is added to the cost of materials, the cost of each filmslide (Lemare) is 1½¢. The Harvard Library,

                  would be much lower. Since all photographing and projecting equipment will yield "A" legibility at a reduction ratio of 15. the
                  Lemare filmslide will copy a surface 18 x 24 inches, equivalent to a spread of two pages of a great 12 x 18 inch folio or news-sheet
                  or one page of a full size newspaper like the New York Times (18 x 22 inches).</p>

               <p>The cost of developing the film is quoted at 2¢ a foot by an Ohio company, and at 1¢ a foot by the Kinogram corporation. The
                  Universal Talking Newsreel quotes the high price of 5¢ per foot. From these quotations the following maximum and minimum costs can

               <p>The technical perfection of the apparatus now on the market is sufficient to recommend it for use in copying all printed and

               <head>Conclusions on the Copying of Newspapers.</head>

               <p>The copying of newspapers by the filmslide process falls just within present technically practicable limits. If the Lemare camera
                  had Leica precision <pb n="113" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=134"/> or the Leica used
                  non-perforated film, there would be no difficulty even with small apparatus. The filmslide method is suited to newspaper copying
                  because it developes its most significant economies in copying very large pages, or in making a small number of copies of a large
                  amount of material. Newspaper reproduction projects which are impossible because of the prohibitive cost of the photostatic or
                  photo-lithographic process may become possible if the filmslide method is used.</p>

               <p>The newspaper is a special case, moreover, because of the high perishability of all newspapers printed through the last fifty
                  years.</p>

               <p>The investigation now under way at the Bureau of Standards has not determined whether it will be possible to treat mechanical wood
                  pulp paper in such a way as to preserve it. If no effective method of preserving ordinary newsprint paper is discovered, or if the
                  method should prove to be too expensive for general use, the device which present technology would indicate as most promising as a
                  means of preserving a fifty years' legacy of perishable paper is the filmslide copying method.</p>

               <pb n="114" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=135"/>

               <p>The filmslide method also enters into the solution of the newspaper problem as a device for completing files, for improving the
                  distribution of the most important newspaper sets throughout the country, or for saving storage space in crowded libraries.</p>

               <p>A standard for measuring newspaper costs is furnished by the New York Times. The subscription price is $18.00 per year. A one-year
                  file, in twenty four bound volumes, on ordinary newsprint paper, is sold for $72, on rag paper for $170. The number of pages is
                  close to 24,000, or two thousand a month. The element of bindery cost in the above quotations is about $2.25 per semi-monthly volume
                  of one thousand pages. Each volume of the newsprint issue costs $3.00 bound, and each volume of the rag paper issue costs $7.08. The
                  cost of a thousand pages of the rag paper file, exclusive of binding, comes to $4.83.</p>

               <p>At a reduction of 20 diameters two pages of the New York Times will go on one unperforated filmslide. The cost could not be higher
                  than 1½¢ nor lower than ½¢ per slide, at which level the following comparisons are in order:</p>

                  costs would be $4.50 per year. The total price of buying and binding a year's issue is therefore $8.55 or $16.50.</p>

               <p>The London Times prints 10,000 pages, each 18½ x 24 inches, per year. This would go on filmslides. at two pages per slide if reduced
                  21 diameters - a safe reduction for B legibility. A year of the Times on filmslides would cost from $28 to $75. This should be
                  compared with the subscription and binding price: $33.50 at domestic subscription rate plus binding in five volumes, and $36.55 at
                  the foreign subscription rate.</p>

               <p>Recent foreign newspaper files are offered on the market at comparable prices. A Nijhoff catalogue offers twelve files of five years
                  each, 1914-19l9 at an average price of $35 per year, bound. A file of Action Irancaise 1900-1928, 28 years in 68 bound volumes is
                  offered for $400, or $2.40 per volume, $5.72 per year. <pb n="117"

                  issues; some are eight or twelve page issues. The price per 100 pages of the back files of European newspapers, including binding,
                  ought to be anything from 20¢ to 40¢.</p>

               <p>It must be concluded that filmslide copies of newspapers can be made at costs within the price range of files of recent papers, or
                  subscriptions to current ones. At its lowest, the filmslide edition of a newspaper may cost but little more than the price of
                  binding the original edition. If land and building costs are so high that the expense of providing storage for a newspaper file
                  exceeds the acquisition cost, it might pay a library to transfer its bulkier newspaper holdings to filmslides for the sake of space
                  economy alone, although it must be recognized that film storage is itself a special problem in which special fire-proofing and
                  temperature conditions must be met.</p>

            <head>V. Note-Taking Equipment.</head>

            <p>The research problem as it comes to the scholar's desk usually calls for a technique of note taking. The reproduction of research
               materials in book or filmslide form ends the work of library institutions. But the scholar's work begins where that of the library
               ends. And here techniques of reproduction ought to be keyed in with the problem of organizing note systems rather than the problem of
               preserving materials.</p>

            <p>An illustration of the labor saving possibilities of new techniques is furnished in the preparation of the Early Modern English
               Dictionary under the direction of Professor C.C. Fries of Michigan. The same method is to be used in the New Dictionary of Middle
               English, under the direction of Professor Samuel Moore. In dictionary work the older technique is to look through the literature of the
               period for the uses of words, copy out the context of each use, and file under the word. In preparing these dictionaries the
               philologist can now receive from the photo-lithographer a hundred or more specially made copies of every book in the form of loose
               leaves, printed on one side, and reduced to a standard note size. He need only underline on a page the words he wishes to take note of;
                  <pb n="119" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=140"/> a typist can then file a separate
               copy of the whole page under each of the words so underlined.</p>

            <p>The filmslide method in note-taking is best adapted to the copying of long documents when no rearrangement of the parts is in view, and
               when it is not necessary to bring together on the same table at the same time a number of items to be compared or combined. Mr. Kennedy
               has been working out a cheap way of mounting and filing each filmslide separately upon a small card. This device would permit the easy
               grouping and arranging of filmslide notes, but would not avoid the objection that in using filmslides the reader can have only one
               document at a time before his eyes.</p>

            <p>When filmslides are used as a part of a note system, it may often be found preferable to read them by means of the Martin magnifying
               glass and ground glass equipment rather than by projection. This method is satisfactory when used in reading filmslides of normal size
               books or manuscript pages, although it cannot be applied to the higher reductions necessary in newspaper reproduction.</p>

            <p>The advertising literature for the Lemare and Leica apparatus both assume that the user will print <pb n="120"
                  facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=141"/> enlarged copies of his filmslides for use as
               notes.</p>

            <p>If this is done, the filmslide is a mere intermediate step in the production of the note, and the economies of the method as against
               the use of the photostat are largely labor economies arising from the fact that the scholar makes the exposures himself. If there were
               on the market a cheap, portable copying apparatus which would copy directly on photostat paper of a convenient note paper size, so
               arranged that the exposed sheets would stack themselves in a light-proof box which could be detached and taken to a photographer's shop
               for developing, one step in the photographic note-taking process would be saved. Notes 5 x 8 inches would cost less than 2 cents each.
               Pages of all sizes would be copied on the same size of note paper, to file in with notes taken in typescript or manuscript. The
               variation in legibility would be more than compensated for by the convenience of the standardized size.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>1. Library Installation of Filmslide Apparatus.</head>

               <p>As a substitute for the photostat in copying books and manuscripts of normal size, present filmslide apparatus for photography,
                  projection or direct reading is satisfactory. But it is a misfortune that the camera with the best lens equipment uses the
                  perforated film, and the only small camera using non-perforated film has the poorer lens equipment.</p>

               <p>It is recommended that the conclusions here reached in the comparison of these two cameras, the Leica and Lemare, be scientifically
                  checked, possibly at the Bureau of Standards.</p>

               <p>If the conclusions as to resolving power here stated are confirmed, - that Leica will give as fine results at 18 diameters as Lemare
                  at 13, - then libraries should be urged to install Leica apparatus; if it is established that the observed differences in fineness
                  are due to differences in the process of developing and fixing the film or to differences in exposure time or to some other factor
                  not inherent in the apparatus, then libraries should be urged to install Lemare equipment.</p>

               <p>In either case, it is very important that all <pb n="122"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=143"/> libraries should install filmslide photography
                  and projection apparatus as a supplement to the photostat equipment, and as a device for taking some of the load off of their
                  lending and borrowing activities.</p>

               <p>The cost accounting done at the University of California established the fact that the expense of borrowing or lending books is
                  $1.59 per volume -- the cost of borrowing being almost exactly equal to the cost of lending. The low cost of filmslide copies would
                  permit the borrowing scholar to purchase copies of many items he would otherwise borrow. This is especially true of short articles
                  in periodicals.</p>

               <p>The Joint Committee should take this matter up with the American Library Association.</p>
            </div>

            <div type="section">
               <head>2. Filmslides and the Newspaper Problem.</head>

               <p>As 3 means of copying newspapers, present photographic apparatus is satisfactory, and present projection apparatus unsatisfactory.
                  Both can be and should be improved. It is not recommended that the filmslide method in its present state be promoted in any large
                  scale project for preserving or completing files of newspapers in libraries, although it may be used as a substitute for the
                  photostat in making <pb n="123" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=144"/> pages of
                  newspapers available to scholars who could not afford to buy photostats. The possibility of organizing large-scale copying
                  operations should be kept in mind as a future part of the program of the Joint Committee, and in the meantime work upon the
                  following technical problems should be stimulated through the Bureau of Standards, the National Council of Research, or some other
                  agency:</p>

               <p>A. A study of the durability of acetate film. If the investigation discloses that film does not possess a life probability
                  sufficient to justify its use in the preservation of records, the possibility of using metal or glass for small scale record
                  photography should be explored. If the metal or glass medium is to be used, the photographic and projecting apparatus would have to
                  be designed to use the "step and repeat" principle, by which a large number of images could be taken upon a single plate.</p>

               <p>B. A study of resolving power and reduction ratio, to determine optimum chemical and optical conditions for copying newsprint, and
                  to make sure that these are met in the apparatus in hand with minimum labor cost factor. Such processes as that invented by Dr.
                  Hutchison should <pb n="124" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=145"/> be tested in this
                  connection.</p>

               <p>C. A more efficient projector should be designed. This might be assigned to an optical company, such as Bausch and Lomb or the
                  Delineascope for commercial development.</p>

               <head>3. Photostat for Note Taking.</head>

               <p>An effort should be made to foster the production of a portable and inexpensive photostat equipment for copying pages of various
                  sizes upon a standard note-size paper. The Joint Committee should communicate with the Rectigraph and Photostat Companies, and might
                  even take measures to verify the reporter's opinion that there would be a commercial demand for such an apparatus.</p>

               <head>4. The Organization of the Book Buying Market in Connection with Book Production.</head>

               <p>The most important recommendation suggested by this survey is the organizing of the buying power of institutions which are already
                  devoting their funds to research purposes. These buyers should control production. Works which do not finance themselves as
                  commercial ventures and must depend on subsidies from the authors or from endowments or revolving funds could finance themselves if
                  the buying power were so organized as to eliminate waste. A survey of scholarly book publication <pb n="125"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=146"/> facilities is being made by Mr. John Marshall
                  under the direction of the American Council of Learned Societies. Pending the completion of his survey, one cannot speak with
                  certainty, but it appears to be true that the limit which now restricts the circulation of research material among scholars is set
                  by the requirements of publishing finance rather than the purchasing power of libraries. But the high cost of publication is due to
                  publishing policies which are not only valueless to the scholar, but even hostile to his purposes.</p>

               <p>It is a consequence of specialization in research that some of the most useful kinds of collaboration among scholars require the
                  circulation of only a limited number of copies of a given publication. But commercial publication cannot live on the limited
                  specialists' market. Therefore the publisher influences the nature of the product in two ways. He constantly brings pressure to bear
                  upon the productive scholar to urge him to prepare his work for a wider audience, and he saddles upon every publishing venture a
                  burden equal to the whole cost of production of the book in order to pay for promotion in the market. The social sciences and
                  humanities are not protected <pb n="126" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=147"/> by the
                  nature of their subject matter from this pressure upon their literature, with the result that even the purchasing power which is
                  wholly within the control of the specialists in the field - such as the funds apportioned to a department in a university library -
                  must be used in part to fill shelves with material that is less useful than it should be because of the pressure upon the author to
                  seek a non-scholarly market.</p>

               <p>The learned periodical helps to relieve this pressure, but not sufficiently, as many instances illustrate. A request has come in to
                  the Joint Committee for funds to continue the publication of a calendar of Brazilian manuscripts. A conference of research men in
                  American History, held in Chicago in November 1931, recommended that facilities for the publication of monographs intermediate in
                  size between books and articles in periodicals should be provided. A librarian in the Cleveland Public Library system, a specialist
                  in Slavic studies, has compiled a bibliography of English translations of Polish literature, which is probably worth publishing but
                  which cannot be financed at present without a subvention from the author. Source materials on the Paris Peace Conference ought to be
                  circulated <pb n="127" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=148"/> and studied as intensively
                  as the source materials on pre-war diplomacy, and testimony taken while the participants in the Conference are still living, but
                  such a venture under present conditions would not pay its way. All these items illustrate the problems which could be met by
                  correlating the organization of book purchasing and book production.</p>

               <p>The starting point in organizing purchasing power in a field is the correlation of two quantities: the amount of material in a given
                  field which the scholars therein would wish to publish if publication could be financed, and the purchasing power which the same
                  scholars share through their ability to control the expenditure of a certain quota of the funds of their respective libraries.</p>

               <p>Any field of scholarship which can organize its purchasing power in one hundred institutions can begin to take command of
                  production, and to secure for itself at normal book prices whatever is deemed most useful for its purposes. An organization of three
                  hundred can free itself from all restrictions, using the additional purchasing power either to reduce purchasing prices or secure
                  better typography and legibility at the <pb n="128" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=149"
                  /> same prices.</p>

               <p>The economies which make this control possible eliminate three-fifths to four-fifths of the normal costs of publication, by getting
                  rid of:</p>
<list type="ordered">
               <item n="a">Promotion costs. (The promotion of books in the scholarly market is done free by the journals anyway.)</item>

               <item n="b">Risk of carrying unsold stock. Elimination of this risk permits the use of more durable paper.</item>

               <item n="c">Editorial costs, except perhaps for a reading fee which might be paid in some fields to the scholar to whom a manuscript is
                  assigned for appraisal. The cost of correcting spelling and punctuation must not be levied upon the purchaser.</item>

               <item n="d">A slight saving in library costs of putting the book on the shelves can be effected by sending catalogue cards along with the
                  books.</item>

               <item n="e">Authors' royalties and publishers’ profits.</item>
</list>
               <p>In connection with the development of purchasing organization, materials for publication can be classified into two groups.</p>

               <pb n="129" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=150"/>

               <p>Group 1, in which the interest of the library predominates. This may be due to their relation to general library policy, to their
                  wide appeal, their bibliographic importance, or their relation to some particular policy of a special library. Examples: Newspaper
                  reproductions in a general library; reproductions of state statutes and law reports in a law library; fac-simile reproductions of
                  books of general interest which are out of print.</p>

               <p>Organization of purchasing power for this class of material should begin with the libraries. The same kind of organization which
                  would solve production problems would also be useful in organizing the completion and distribution of serial and government document
                  sets.</p>

               <p>Group II, in which the interest of the specialized research scholar predominates. The same men are interested in securing the
                  publication of their own work and in acquiring the work of others for their own libraries. Examples: Monographic work; biographical
                  source material concerning persons whose importance lies solely in one field.</p>

               <p>Organization of purchasing power for this class of material might well begin with the learned societies and <pb n="130"
                     facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=151"/> their committees. some or them have
                  publication committees which could be asked to study a broader program based on the possibility of self-financed publication. Within
                  the A.C.L.S. there are a number of subject matter committees which might be willing to extend their functions.</p>

               <p>Since the practices of institutions vary as to the responsibilities of the librarian and the research personnel for the initiative
                  in acquisition, projects which would be primarily matters of Department discretion in one university might be primarily a matter of
                  Library responsibility in another. Certainly every step taken will require complete accord between research personnel and library.
                  There are some projects which would be too narrow in scope to be regarded as matters of general library policy, and yet too broad to
                  fall within any one research field -- for example, the publication of Paris Peace Conference Documents. But if both the libraries
                  and the scholarly personnel are organized, every worthy project for which there are over a hundred purchasers can be published and
                  distributed.</p>

               <head>Action by the Joint Committee</head>

               <p>The object described in the foregoing paragraphs cannot be attained out of hand, by drawing up schemes for an organization upon
                  paper and having it voted upon. Existing institutions must be used wherever possible, and existing wants should be met, as they

                  <head>A. Publishing Projects in Search of Funds.</head>

                  <p>Since any project will finance itself if there is an advance subscription to the requisite number of copies, it is not necessary
                     to organize a field or scholarship or a system of libraries in order to work out the practical application of the plan. If

                     whether it controls the purchasing power needed for publication. Maximum price and minimum legibility should be specified. The

                     involves both elements, they should be separately considered.</p>

                  <p>3) If circularizing of institutions and individuals, or the sponsorship of the journals, results in a subscription list of more
                     than one hundred, publication can be financed out of purchase money; if not, the subvention can be reconsidered.</p>

                  <p>Among the existing organizations which might be consulted under (1) above: the publication committees or the learned societies,
                     especially those which possess revolving funds, and the Fac-Simile Text society, or Edwards Brothers if the publication required
                     is a reprint <pb n="133" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=154"/> of an out-of-print
                     publication. The Fac-Simile Text Society invites suggestions of titles for publication, and follows the judgment of its editors
                     in making decisions. Edwards Brothers proposes to receive from Libraries requests for a fac-simile copy of any manuscript or
                     out-of-print book, to circularize libraries and produce the fac-simile at a price based upon the number of subscribers.</p>

                  <head>B. Funds in Search of Publishing Projects.</head>

                  <p>The Joint Committee might ask scholarly publishing agencies, committees, revolving funds, etc. to define their policies in
                     respect of the following two principles:</p>

                  <p>1) That photo-lithographed typescript can be substituted for printing in small editions.</p>

                  <p>2) That it is neither necessary nor desirable that the edition of every work published should reach its maximum size or receive
                     maximum distribution; it is more important that the number of copies distributed should be strategically located, since only the
                     greatest libraries can specialize in everything.</p>

                  <p>Any field of scholarship in which there is established a publishing agency which works on these <pb n="134"
                        facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=155"/> principles is in a position to take full
                     advantage of the new publishing processes if its publication committee can be put directly in touch with the representatives of
                     buying power. The Joint Committee should help to create such a liason in these cases.</p>

                  <p>An arrangement of this kind is under consideration by the officers of the National Council of Teachers of English. The terms at
                     present under discussion with Edwards Brothers involve the use of a small revolving fund.</p>

                  <head>C. Library Collaboration in Purchasing.</head>

                  <p>Mr. Gerould at Princeton has warned the Joint Committee of the probability that the publication of the check list of Government
                     Documents will be followed by a system of rare-book prices among the booksellers dealing in these documents, and has suggested
                     that library purchasing policies should be worked out in such a way as to avoid cut-throat competition in acquisition. Any
                     organization of library purchasing power which could deal with government document acquisition policies could also control
                     publication of fac-similes of important and widely demanded documents which are out of print, and <pb n="135"
                        facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=156"/> could pass from that to the control of
                     publication of other materials in which general library interest predominates. This problem of Library organization has already
                     been discussed by the Joint Committee. Any action taken in connection with Mr. Gerould's suggestion will carry out part of the
                     recommendation resulting from this Survey.</p>

                  <head>D. Newspaper Reproduction.</head>

                  <p>An experiment should be made to test the demand for reproductions of old newspaper files in editions of over one hundred,
                     reproduced by photolithographv. If one important newspaper were selected, the project explained in the political science and
                     historical publications, and a broader basis of subscription sought than could be obtained for photostat copies, it is oossible
                     that a market would be discovered which would take care of all fac-simile newspaper publication.</p>

                  <p>Quite distinct from the problem of reproducing old newspapers is the problem of preserving current newspapers which are printed
                     on cheap paper. A Survey of newspaper acquisition policies has been voted by the Joint Committee, but no work done upon it. If
                     the Survey <pb n="136" facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=157"/> should reveal that any
                     newspapers are now being currently bound by more than one hundred libraries, the libraries should be consulted to determine
                     whether they would wish to have current files reproduced for them half size upon durable paper. The New York Times, or any
                     newspaper which is printed on rag stock, would not require such reproduction. Arrangements might be made in Europe for the
                     preparation, at the lower European prices, of photo-lithographed half-size copies of a few of the great European dailies. Even if
                     the number of libraries now binding these newspapers is too small to finance the reproduction scheme, the number might be
                     increased when the project defines itself.</p>

                  <head>E. Model Enterprises to be Sponsored by the Joint Committee.</head>

                  <p>The Joint Committee might select two enterprises to be sponsored by it and carried through as a demonstration of the
                     possibilities of bringing organized purchasing power directly into touch with the problem of publishing. One such enterprise
                     should lie in a field where there is pressure by research scholars for more adequate publishing facilities. This would be a
                     problem in setting up an organization. The other should lie in a field <pb n="137"
                        facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=158"/> where there is a demand that certain
                     material be made more accessible. It would be a matter of carrying through a project.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Marshall's report on the use of revolving funds should suggest the most strategic place in which to undertake to organize
                     purchasing power to meet the demand of research publication, thus creating a sample organization.</p>

                  <p>Professor Shotwell, now chairman of the International Relations Committee of the S.S.R.C., has in mind the preparation of a
                     documentary history of the Paris Peace Conference. This might perhaps be used as a sample project. If a sample organization and a
                     sample project were successful, the scholarly world would begin to think in new terms of the problem of publication.</p>

                  <head>F. Further Study of Legibility and Typography.</head>

                  <p>There is a direct relationship between legibility, cost, and size of market necessary to float an enterprise. The line of
                     investigation begun under the auspices of the Joint Committee should be continued until three or four standards of legibility are
                     defined, and the least costly way of producing each of them determined.</p>

                  <p>It is suggested that In studies of legibility newsprint be <pb n="138"
                        facs="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015041315394;view=1up;seq=159"/> taken as a standard, and that legibilities
                     be graded as so many points above or below newsprint legibility. This standard should be selected because newsprint is familiar
                     to everyone. Professors Paterson and Tinker of the University of Minnesota might be asked to continue the work begun in
                     connection with this survey. This project may fall more nearly within the province of the National Research Council. It should be
                     pressed forward in any case.</p>

                  <p>This survey is being printed in an edition of 100 copies, free of charge, by Edwards Brothers of Ann Arbor. Many of these copies
                     have been promised to persons who have furnised information toward the compilation of the survey. Other copies should be
                     circulated for criticism by competent persons in the several fields.</p>

                  <p>The result of criticism, together with the result of action by the Joint committee, and any further information that may come to
                     hand, should be worked up into a new edition of the Survey which can be used in carrying out the plans of the Joint Committee by
                     presenting its point of view in full. The comparison of Leica <pb n="139"

                     recommended before the survey issues in final form. Even the work on legibility should be developed further than it is here
                     carried out, so that sample pages of attested degrees of legibility, each illustrating the lowest cost of that particular degree
                     of legibility, should be incorporated in the report. The new edition of the Survey could then be circulated among the publication
                     committees of the learned societies and the libraries.</p>
